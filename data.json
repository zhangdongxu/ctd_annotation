    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of bone turnover on glucose homeostasis, fat distribution and adipokine production during anabolic treatment with PTH. This is a parallel, randomized controlled, open label, trial. The randomization was done by computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Forty-six postmenopausal osteoporotic non-diabetic women were assigned to treatment with calcium and colecalcipherol with (24) or without (22) PTH 1-84. Patients were recalled after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of treatment and markers of bone turnover, glucose metabolism, adipokine secretion and fat distribution were analyzed. Markers of bone turnover and adipokines were measured by ELISA. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by an oral glucose load test and insulin resistance and secretion were calculated. Fat and lean mass were evaluated by anthropometric measures. The effect of treatment on measured variables was analyzed by repeated measure test, and its effect on glucose was also evaluated by mediation analysis after correction for possible confounders. Twenty patients in the calcium and vitamin D groups and 19 in the group treated with PTH 1-84 completed the study. There were no significance adverse events. Treatment with PTH increases osteocalcin, both total (OC) and undercarboxylated (uOC), and decreases blood glucose, without influence on insulin secretion, resistance and pancreatic beta cell function. Treatment with PTH does not influence fat distribution and adipokine production. The results of the mediation analyses suggest a total effect of PTH on blood glucose, moderately mediated by OC and to a less extent by uOC. Here we suggest that treatment with PTH influences glucose metabolism partially through its effect on bone turnover, without influence on insulin secretion, resistance, pancreatic beta cell function and fat mass.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory activities in macrophages by competition for transcriptional coactivators with some transcriptional factors, including NF-kappaB. In the present study the influence of PPARgamma activators on IFN-gamma-elicited macrophage stimulation and signaling cascades was investigated. The results show that IFN-gamma-induced inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene transcription, iNOS protein induction, and NO production are more sensitive to inhibition by 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15dPGJ(2)) than by the other two PPARgamma agonists, GW1929 and ciglitazone. Delayed addition of 15dPGJ(2) for 2 h resulted in reduced inhibition, suggesting action by 15dPGJ(2) on the upstream signaling cascades. Immunoblotting, DNA binding, and reporter gene assays consistently revealed the inhibitory ability of 15dPGJ(2), but not GW1929 or ciglitazone, on IFN-gamma-elicited signaling cascades, including tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus tyrosine protein kinase 2 and STAT1, DNA binding, and IFN regulatory factor-1 trans-activation of STAT1. These effects of 15dPGJ(2) were not abrogated by the PPARgamma antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, indicating the PPARgamma-independent actions. 15dPGJ(2) also attenuated IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in Hep3B hepatoma cells. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of reactive oxygen species on STAT1 signaling, STAT1 inhibition by 15dPGJ(2) was abrogated by N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. Furthermore, 15dPGJ(2)-induced inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and NO production still occurred in the presence of peroxovanadate, ruling out the action mechanism of 15dPGJ(2) on tyrosine phosphatase. Taken together, for the first time in this study we demonstrate that 15dPGJ(2) can inhibit cytokine-stimulated Janus kinase 2-STAT signaling through a PPARgamma-independent, reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism. These data provide a novel molecular mechanism of iNOS inhibition by 15dPGJ(2) and confirm its physiological role in anti-inflammation.",

    "abstract": "We report results of a hospital-based case control study of 137 consecutive patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia (AA) in participating hospitals over a 4-year period. Diagnoses were made by a single laboratory, subjects were age- and gender-matched to two controls and interviewed concerning previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents. Analysis was conducted on two distinct subgroups: severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and moderate aplastic anemia (MAA). In univariate regression models, the strongest associations were observed for exposure to benzene and SAA (OR=3.12, 95% CI=1.12-8.65) and life on a farm and MAA (OR=3.08, 95% CI=1.44-6.56). Benzene exposure did not show a strong dose-response relationship with either subtype. When accounting for all of the potential confounders we considered in conditional regression models, the previous relationships persisted. Other explanatory variables included hair-dye use for MAA and farm exposures, such as livestock for SAA, although most of these additional variables fell just short of statistical significance. Adjusted R-squared values were only 10% for each subtype, leaving 90% of AA occurrence unexplained. Our results suggest that: (a) benzene exposure is more strongly related to SAA than MAA, (b) farm and livestock exposures are related to both forms of AA, confirming some previous results, and (c) a large percentage of AA remains unexplained, which may indicate that individual susceptibility has a major influence on AA occurrence.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of budesonide Turbuhaler 400 microg/day with budesonide aqua 256 microg/day in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Secondarily to ascertain patients' preferences for the two nasal devices and to assess quality of life. DESIGN: Randomized, multicentre, double-blind, double- dummy, parallel groups study. SETTING: Private practices and hospital clinics in Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. POPULATION: Two hundred and eighty-four out-patients with SAR, who were symptomatic during the ragweed season, volunteered for enrolment (243 randomized). RESULTS: Mean daily nasal symptom scores were significantly reduced with treatment. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline for eye symptoms. Most patients (more than 80%) achieved substantial control of their symptoms with budesonide. The most common nasal and non-nasal adverse events for both groups were epistaxis and headache. Turbuhaler was easier to use and more convenient to carry, had less of an unpleasant taste, and caused less nasal irritation than the aqua spray. More than twice as many patients preferred Turbuhaler to the aqua spray (69% versus 31%). Improvement in quality of life from baseline to clinic visits was statistically significant in both groups. CONCLUSION: Once daily use of 256 mg of budesonide aqua and 400 mg of budesonide Turbuhaler are equally safe and efficacious in the treatment of SAR. Patients preferred the budesonide powder formulation delivered via Turbuhaler two to one over the aqua formulation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the cardiac status of the long-term survivors and to estimate the incidence and the features of subclinical cardiotoxicity induced after conventional treatment with doxorubicin for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a group of patients who previously received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for lymphoma. Echocardiograms were performed at least 5 years after therapy with anthracyclines. Clinical cardiomyopathy was defined by the presence of clinical signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). Subclinical cardiomyopathy was defined by decrease of left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) without clinical signs of CHF. Cumulative dose of doxorubicin, male sex, older age, relapse, radiotherapy (mediastinal or total-body irradiation), autologous stem-cell transplantation, high-dose cyclophosphamide, and cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, familial history of cardiac disease, being overweight, and smoking history) were evaluated as potential risk factors for the development of cardiac dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 141 assessable patients (median age, 54 years; median cumulative dose of doxorubicin, 300 mg/m(2)), only one developed CHF. Criteria of subclinical cardiomyopathy were found in 39 patients. In multivariate analysis, factors that contributed to decreased FS were male sex (P &lt;.01), older age (P &lt;.01), higher cumulative dose of doxorubicin or association with another anthracycline (P =.04), radiotherapy (P =.04), and being overweight (P =.04). CONCLUSION: Cardiac abnormalities can occur in patients treated with doxorubicin for lymphoma in the absence of CHF, even in patients who received moderate anthracycline doses. Male sex, older age, higher dose of doxorubicin, radiotherapy, and being overweight were risk factors for the development of cardiomyopathy.",

    "title": "Anticonvulsant effect of flutamide on seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole: involvement of benzodiazepine receptors. ",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: There is some structural similarity between the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide (Flut) and benzodiazepines (BZDs). We evaluated the possible anticonvulsant effect and interaction of Flut with BZD receptors in common seizure models. METHODS: (a) Different groups of mice each were pretreated i.p. with Flut, and after 0.5 h, they received chemoconvulsants [pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), bicuculline, aminophylline, strychnine or kainic acid]. Latency and incidence of a clonic seizure were recorded. (b) Mice were pretreated i.p. with Flut, and after 0.5 h, transauricular electroshock was applied. Occurrence of a tonic seizure was observed. (c) Amygdala-kindled rats were pretreated i.p. with Flut, and 0.5, 1, or 2 h later, they were stimulated at afterdischarge threshold. Then the seizure parameters (afterdischarge duration, seizure severity, and stage 5 duration) were recorded. (d) The effect of Flut on clonic seizure threshold was determined by i.v. infusion of bicuculline or PTZ to different groups of Flut-receiving mice. To determine the possible interaction of Flut with BZD receptors, the flumazenil (FMZ)+Flut effect on clonic seizure threshold was compared with the effect of Flut. (e) Neurotoxicity of Flut was evaluated by rotarod test at 30 min after administration. RESULTS: Flut produced a dose-dependent anticonvulsant effect against PTZ-induced seizures [median effective dose (ED50), 67.0 mg/kg]. Moreover, Flut elevated the clonic seizure threshold induced by bicuculline or PTZ. FMZ reversed the effect of Flut on the threshold of PTZ seizures. A median toxic dose (TD50) value of 124.8 mg/kg was obtained for Flut. CONCLUSIONS: Flut both blocks PTZ-induced clonic seizures and elevates the threshold of PTZ or bicuculline-induced clonic seizures, through interaction with BZD receptors.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study cytotoxic effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on the human lens epithelium cells and to identify the biological mechanism for these effects. METHODS: In this experimental study, human lens epithelium cells (FHL124 cells) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The effects of As2O3 on FHL124 cells growth were tested by MTT, and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Gene changes were detected by real-time PCR (Taqman). As2O3-induced changes in cell calcium level were measured by real-time fluorometric single-cell digital imaging techniques after Fura-2 incorporation. RESULTS: As2O3 inhibited the growth of FHL 124 cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, given an IC50 value of 1.5 micromol/L. As2O3 induced apoptosis of FHL124 cells as showed by TUNEL assay. As2O3 provoked an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response identified through an up regulation of EIF2A, ERN1 and ATF6 (F = 8.51, P = 0.0005). As2O3 depleted the calcium store and consequently lead to a decrease of calcium signaling (P = 0.0018). Moreover, As2O3 had a moderate effect on the calcium influx pathway. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 inhibits the growth and induces apoptosis of human lens epithelium cells. As2O3 provokes an ER stress which could be the cause of apoptic processes.",

    "abstract": "The Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme family comprises a wide array of monooxygenases involved in the oxidation of endobiotic and xenobiotic molecules. The active site of a CYP enzyme contains an iron protoporphyrin center coordinated to a cysteine thiolate, and then, molecular oxygen is associated with the iron to be converted into dioxygen complex plus substrate. Reduction by CYP reductase expedites hydroxylation of the compound. In this oxidation reaction, insufficient oxygen molecules would affect enzyme catalysis. Nevertheless, biochemical data about CYP kinetics at low oxygen concentrations are not available. In this work, we present the results on the variation in rat liver microsomal CYP Vmax app and Km app under normal and hypoxic conditions. Using alkoxyresorufin molecules as substrates, the Vmax/Km ratios for resorufin production decreased from 426 to 393 for CYP1A1 and from 343 to 202 for CYP2B1 at a low oxygen concentration (4.1 ppm) compared to the ratios observed at a normal oxygen concentration (6.5 ppm). Additionally, the bacterial mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene and cyclophosphamide, decreased by 32% and 42%, respectively, at low oxygen concentrations. These results support the hypothesis that low oxygen availability is implicated in the low efficiency of substrate oxidation by CYP.",

    "abstract": "The experimentally induced neurotoxic effects of paclitaxel and docetaxel have never been compared, since no animal models of docetaxel peripheral neurotoxicity have yet been reported. In this experiment, we examined the effect of the chronic administration of these two taxanes in the Wistar rat using neurophysiological, neuropathological and morphometrical methods. Our results showed that both paclitaxel and docetaxel induced a significant, equally severe and dose-dependent reduction in nerve conduction velocity. On the contrary, the morphometric examination demonstrated that the effect on the nerve fibres was more severe after paclitaxel administration when the same schedule was used. However, the overall severity of the pathological changes was milder than expected on the basis of the neurophysiological results. Our results support the hypothesis that taxanes (and particularly docetaxel) may exert their neurotoxic effect not only on the microtubular system of the peripheral nerves, but also on other less obvious targets.",

    "title": "Beta 2-adrenergic receptor regulation of human neutrophil function is sexually dimorphic. ",
    "abstract": "While the mechanisms underlying the marked sexual dimorphism in inflammatory diseases are not well understood, the sexually dimorphic sympathoadrenal axis profoundly affects the inflammatory response. We tested whether adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of human neutrophil function is sexually dimorphic, since neutrophils provide the first line of defense in the inflammatory response. There was a marked sexual dimorphism in beta(2)-adrenergic receptor binding, using the specific beta(2)-adrenergic receptor ligand, [(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol, with almost three times more binding sites on neutrophils from females (20,878 +/- 2470) compared to males (7331 +/- 3179). There was also a marked sexual dimorphism in the effects of isoprenaline, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, which increased nondirected locomotion (chemokinesis) in neutrophils obtained from females, while having no effect on neutrophils from males. Isoprenaline stimulated the release of a chemotactic factor from neutrophils obtained from females, but not from males. This chemotactic factor acts on the G protein-coupled CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) chemokine receptor, since an anti-CXCR2 antibody and the selective nonpeptide CXCR2 antagonist SB225002, inhibited chemotaxis produced by this factor. While interleukin- (IL-) 8 is a principal CXCR2 ligand, isoprenaline did not produce an increase in IL-8 release from neutrophils. IL-8-induced chemotaxis was inhibited in a sexually dimorphic manner by isoprenaline, which also stimulated release of a mediator from neutrophils that induced chemotaxis, that was inhibited by anti-CXCR2 antibodies. These findings indicate an important role for adrenergic receptors in the modulation of neutrophil trafficking, which could contribute to sex-differences in the inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) is a representative J-series cyclopentenone prostaglandin bearing an electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. In the present study, treatment of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with 15d-PGJ(2) caused the up-regulation of the glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) subunit, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. 15d-PGJ(2) treatment caused nuclear translocation and transactivation of Nrf2, a redox-sensitive transcription factor responsible for induced expression of antioxidant and other cytoprotective genes. siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 abrogated 15d-PGJ(2)-induced GCLC expression. Following 15d-PGJ(2) treatment, the intracellular GSH level was initially diminished but eventually enhanced even above the basal level. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) abolished the 15d-PGJ2-induced Nrf2 activation and GCLC expression. Pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA knockdown of Akt, the target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), attenuated 15d-PGJ(2)-induced Nrf2 activation and GCLC expression, and NAC treatment inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, and subsequently Nrf2 activation and GCLC upregulation. 9,10-Dihydro-15-PGJ2, a nonelectrophilic analogue of 15d-PGJ(2) that lacks the ability to form a conjugate with GSH, failed to induce activation of Akt and Nrf2 as well as ROS generation. These findings, taken all together, suggest that intracellular accumulation of ROS formed as a consequence of initial depletion of GSH can activate Akt, which in turn induces Nrf2 activation and subsequently the expression of GCLC, leading to the restoration of GSH. Interestingly, the extracellular GSH level was increased, concomitantly with the depletion of the intracellular GSH following 15d-PGJ(2) treatment. However, 15d-PGJ(2) was unable to influence both intra- and extra-cellular GSH levels when multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), the efflux pump for GSH conjugates, was blocked by its antagonist, MK571. Moreover, 15d-PGJ(2)-induced GCLC expression was attenuated by the MK571 and also by siRNA knockdown of MRP1, suggesting that MRP1 contributes to 15d-PGJ(2)-mediated up-regulation of GCLC by pumping out the 15d-PGJ(2)-GSH conjugate. It is speculated that 15d-PGJ(2), once effluxed through MRP, liberates from the GSH conjugate, and the free 15d-PGJ(2) re-enters the cell and forms the GSH conjugate again. In conclusion, MRP1 mediates Nrf2-dependent up-regulation of GCLC in 15d-PGJ(2)-treated MCF-7 cells, possibly via a putative recycling loop of 15d-PGJ(2)-GSH conjugation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cocaine use is associated with myocardial ischemia and infarction, but it is unclear whether this is only because of the acute effects of cocaine on heart rate, blood pressure, and vasomotor tone or whether accelerated atherosclerosis from long-term exposure to cocaine also contributes. METHODS: We sought to measure the association between cocaine exposure and coronary calcification, a marker for atherosclerosis, among participants in the CARDIA Study who received computed tomography scanning and answered questions about illicit drug use at the year 15 examination in 2000-2001. RESULTS: Among 3038 CARDIA participants (age 33-45 years, 55% women and 45% black), past cocaine exposure was reported by 35% and was more common among men, smokers, drinkers, and participants with less education. Powdered cocaine exposure was more common among whites, crack cocaine among blacks. Before adjustment, cocaine exposure was strongly associated with coronary calcification. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, family history, and habits, however, these associations disappeared: adjusted odds ratios for coronary calcification were 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.3) for 1 to 10, 1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.7) for 11 to 99, and 1.0 (95% CI 0.6-1.6) for &gt; or =100 lifetime episodes of cocaine use, in comparison with none. Sex, tobacco, and alcohol use appeared to be primarily responsible for the confounding we observed in unadjusted models. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of a causal relationship between long-term exposure to cocaine and coronary calcification and conclude that acute nonatherogenic mechanisms probably explain most cocaine-associated myocardial infarction.",

    "title": "An assessment of the safety and efficacy of sibutramine, an anti-obesity drug with a novel mechanism of action. ",
    "abstract": "Sibutramine is a combined serotonin(5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA)re-uptake inhibitor. Sibutramine works predominantly through its two pharmacologically active metabolites (i.e. primary and secondary amines) which induce marked weight loss by affecting both food intake and energy expenditure. It is able to enhance the physiological process of satiety, and to stimulate thermogenesis, increasing the efferent sympathetic activity to thermogenically active brown fat. There is a dose-related reduction in body weight in clinical trials with sibutramine, with weight loss up to 11% below baseline, which can last up to 18 months with continued treatment. When weight loss is induced with a very low calorie diet (VLCDL), patients randomized to the sibutramine treatment continued to lose weight over a 1 year period, reaching 15% below baseline, whereas the placebo-treated patients regained some weight. Sibutramine improves metabolic fitness, by decreasing the biochemical risk factors associated with obesity, such as plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, glucose and insulin, and increasing HDL-cholesterol. In controlled studies, 84% of sibutramine-treated patients reported side effects, most commonly including dry mouth, constipation and insomnia, compared with 71% of patients receiving placebo. A small increase in heart rate and blood pressure also occurs and persists for as long as treatment is continued, which, therefore, requires monitoring. Nevertheless, successful treatment of moderately hypertensive obese patients with sibutramine has been demonstrated without undue blood pressure problems and even a mean lowering of blood pressure associated with weight loss. Finally, sibutramine does not have the potential for abuse that is characteristic of amphetamine and it is indistinguishable from placebo in abuse potential studies.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, nanotechnology environmental health and safety (nanoEHS) is gaining attention. We previously found that silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) could induce vascular endothelial damage. However, the subsequent toxicologic response to SiNPs-induced endothelial damage was still largely unknown. In this study, we explored the inflammation-coagulation response and thrombotic effects of SiNPs in endothelial cells and zebrafish embryos. For in vitro study, swollen mitochondria and autophagosome were observed in ultrastructural analysis. The cytoskeleton organization was disrupted by SiNPs in vascular endothelial cells. The release of proinflammatory and procoagulant cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, PECAM-1, TF and vWF, were markedly elevated in a dose-dependent manner. For in vivo study, based on the NOAEL for dosimetry selection, and using two transgenic zebrafish, Tg(mpo:GFP) and Tg(fli-1:EGFP), SiNPs-induced neutrophil-mediated inflammation and impaired vascular endothelial cells. With the dosage higher than NOAEL, SiNPs significantly decreased blood flow and velocity, exhibiting a blood hypercoagulable state in zebrafish embryos. The thrombotic effect was assessed by o-dianisidine staining, showed that an increasing of erythrocyte aggregation occurred in SiNPs-treated zebrafish. Microarray analysis was used to screen the possible genes for inflammation-coagulation response to SiNPs in zebrafish, and the JAK1/TF signaling pathway was further verified by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. For in-deepth study, il6st was knocked down with specific morpholinos. The whole-mount in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression jak1 and f3b were attenuated in il6st knockdown groups. In summary, our data demonstrated that SiNPs could induce inflammation-coagulation response and thrombotic effects via JAK1/TF signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Endometriosis is the abnormal growth of endometrial cells outside the uterus, causing pelvic pain and infertility. Furthermore, adhesion of endometrial tissue fragments to pelvic mesothelium is required for the initial step of endometriosis formation outside uterus. TGF-beta1 and adhesion molecules importantly function for adhesion of endometrial tissue fragments to mesothelium outside uterus. However, the function of TGF-beta1 on the regulation of adhesion molecule expression for adhesion of endometrial tissue fragments to mesothelium has not been fully elucidated. Interestingly, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression was higher in endometriotic epithelial cells than in normal endometrial cells. The adhesion efficiency of endometriotic epithelial cells to mesothelial cells was also higher than that of normal endometrial cells. Moreover, TGF-beta1 directly induced the adhesion of endometrial cells to mesothelial cells through the regulation of integrin of alphaV, alpha6, beta1, and beta4 via the activation of the TGF-beta1/TGF-betaRI/Smad2 signaling pathway. Conversely, the adhesion of TGF-beta1-stimulated endometrial cells to mesothelial cells was clearly reduced following treatment with neutralizing antibodies against specific TGF-beta1-mediated integrins alphaV, beta1, and beta4 on the endometrial cell membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-beta1 may act to promote the initiation of endometriosis by enhancing integrin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. [BMB Reports 2017; 50(8): 429-434].",

    "abstract": "Pb (lead) exposure and stress are co-occurring risk factors (particularly in low socioeconomic communities) that also act on common biological substrates and produce common adverse outcomes, including cognitive impairments. This study sought to determine whether lifetime Pb exposure combined with prenatal stress would enhance the cognitive deficits independently associated with each of these risk factors and to explore associated mechanisms of any observed impairments. Learning was evaluated using a multiple schedule of repeated learning and performance in female rats subjected to lifetime Pb exposure (0 or 50 ppm Pb in drinking water beginning in dams 2 months prior to breeding; blood Pb levels ~10 mug/dl), to prenatal restraint stress on gestational days 16 and 17, or to both. Blood Pb, corticosterone levels, brain monoamines, and hippocampal nerve growth factor levels were also measured. Sequence-specific learning deficits produced by Pb, particularly the number of responses to correctly learn response sequences, were further enhanced by stress, whereas performance measures were unimpaired. Statistical analyses indicated significant relationships among corticosterone levels, frontal cortex dopamine (DA), nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover, and total responses required to learn sequences. This study demonstrates that Pb and stress can act together to produce selective and highly condition-dependent deficits in learning in female rats that may be related to glucocorticoid-mediated interactions with mesocorticolimbic regions of brain. These findings also underscore the critical need to evaluate toxicants in the context of other risk factors pertinent to human diseases and disorders.",

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-six cases of gouty arthritis were divided into three groups randomly, 58 cases in traditional Chinese drug (TCD)-treated group, 56 cases in Western medicine (WM)-treated group and 52 cases in TCD plus WM-treated group. They were all treated for 12 weeks. In the acute stage, patients in TCD-treated group were treated with Huzhang Gout Granule and Jinhuang Ointment, and patients in WM-treated group were treated with diclofenac sodium dual release enteric-coated capsules. In the intermission, patients in TCD-treated group were given Yinlian Gout Granule, and patients in WM-treated group were given benzbromarone or allopurinol. Patients in TCD plus WM-treated group were given both TCD and WM. Clinical symptom score and blood uric acid (BUA) level were measured. The effect initiating time, relapse rate, efficacy rate and the incidence rate of adverse effects were also studied. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the efficacy rate and effect initiating time among the three groups in the acute stage. The clinical symptom score and BUA level were obviously reduced in three groups. In the intermission, BUA level in the WM-treated group and TCD plus WM-treated group were obviously reduced. Although there was a drop tendency in the BUA level in TCD-treated group, there was no statistical difference. The relapse rates in TCD-, WM- and TCD plus WM-treated groups were 12.07%, 26.79% and 9.62%, respectively. There was statistical difference in relapse rates among the three groups (P&lt;0.05). The relapse rate was decreased in TCD plus WM-treated group as compared with those in TCD-treated and WM-treated groups. The average clinical symptom scores during recurrence in the three groups were (10.00+/-3.61), (12.38+/-1.85) and (10.75+/-1.89), respectively. The incidence of adverse effects in TCD-treated group (3.45%) was lower than the other two groups (21.43% and 15.38%). CONCLUSION: The combination therapy of traditional Chinese and Western medicines based on the stage of disease can control the symptoms of gouty arthritis in the acute stage, improve joint function, and can control the BUA level during the intermission, prevent recurrence and relieve the adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 is a recently identified circulating factor which causes renal phosphate wasting disorders. Although the mechanism of regulation of FGF-23 secretion is unknown, plasma FGF-23 level may be regulated or affected by serum phosphate levels because of its hypophosphatemic effect. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that plasma FGF-23 levels may be increased in hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis. We measured plasma FGF-23 levels in 158 male uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Plasma samples were obtained before starting dialysis sessions to determine FGF-23 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Plasma FGF-23 level exhibited significant and positive correlations with inorganic phosphate, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), corrected calcium, and duration of hemodialysis on simple regression analyses. All these associations remained significant in multiple regression analyses. CONCLUSION: Serum phosphate, calcium, and intact PTH could be regulators of FGF-23 levels in uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Our results may provide new insights into the pathophysiologic effects of FGF-23 on calcium-phosphate homeostasis.",

    "title": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition down-regulates survivin and facilitates TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastomas. ",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Recent findings have correlated neuroblastoma development with aberration of apoptosis. In particular, increased levels of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, have been associated with increased resistance to apoptosis in neuroblastomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway can alter the expression of survivin and facilitate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. METHODS: Human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH, BE[2]C, LAN-1 and IMR-32) were treated with LY294002 or wortmannin, inhibitors of PI3K, for 24 hours. Transient transfection of a dominant negative PI3K expression plasmid, pCGNN-Deltap85, was performed to inhibit PI3K activation. Cells were treated with TRAIL, caspase-3, or pan-caspase inhibitors. RNase protection assay was performed to assess mRNA changes in IAP family members, including survivin. Western blot analysis was performed to measure changes in the levels of procaspases and survivin. Apoptosis was assessed by a DNA fragmentation ELISA assay. RESULTS: The authors found that survivin and cIAP1 mRNA as well as protein expression were decreased after PI3K inhibition. Combination treatment with LY294002 and TRAIL increased apoptosis of SK-N-SH cells compared with TRAIL alone; these results were further corroborated by complete inhibition of apoptosis by caspase-3 or pan-caspase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: The authors report that PI3K pathway inhibition down-regulates survivin expression and enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastomas. PI3K pathway may play a crucial role in neuroblastoma cell survival; therefore, treatment with inhibitors of PI3K may provide potential novel therapeutic options.",

It is essential in the treatment of such areas as the central nervous system (CNS) and reproductive organs. High-dose chemotherapy is applied for this purpose to obtain an effective plasma concentration in the target organs. There are three major mechanisms of nephrotoxicity related with MTX. One is that induced by allergic reaction, which usually appears as interstitial nephritis. In this case MTX is contraindicated. Another is direct pharmacological toxicity against renal tubules. The third is precipitation of MTX, which plugs the renal tubules. The latter two are consequently dose dependent, and are usually associated with high-dose chemotherapy. To prevent these nephrotoxicities, hydration and alkalinization of the urine are performed to accelerate the urinary excretion and avoid the precipitation of MTX.",

Total PKC activity in cancer tissue was significantly decreased compared to that in normal mucosa. Western blotting, using PKC isoenzyme-specific antibodies, showed that two PKC isoenzymes, PKC beta and PKC epsilon, were significantly decreased in cancer tissue. The level of PKC delta was increased in cancer tissue and the expression of PKC alpha and zeta was not altered significantly. Primary bile acids--cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)--and the principal secondary bile acids--deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)--were found to be potent and selective activators of partially purified PKC isoenzymes. PKC beta 1 was the isoenzyme most effectively activated by secondary bile acids.

    "abstract": "Gentamicin is a mainstay in treating gram-negative sepsis. However, it also may potentiate endotoxin (LPS)-driven plasma TNF-alpha increases. Because gentamicin accumulates in renal tubules, this study addressed whether gentamicin directly alters LPS-driven tubular cell TNF-alpha production. HK-2 proximal tubular cells were incubated for 18 h with gentamicin (10-2,000 microg/ml). Subsequent LPS-mediated TNF-alpha increases (at 3 or 24 h; protein/mRNA) were determined. Gentamicin effects on overall protein synthesis ([(35)S]methionine incorporation), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels, and LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha generation by isolated mouse proximal tubules also were assessed. Finally, because gentamicin undergoes partial biliary excretion, its potential influence on gut TNF-alpha/MCP-1 mRNAs was probed. Gentamicin caused striking, dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-driven TNF-alpha production (up to 80% in HK-2 cells/isolated tubules). Surprisingly, this occurred despite increased TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation. Comparable changes in MCP-1 were observed. These changes were observed at clinically relevant gentamicin concentrations and despite essentially normal overall protein synthetic rates. Streptomycin also suppressed LPS-driven TNF-alpha increases, suggesting an aminoglycoside drug class effect. Gentamicin doubled basal TNF-alpha mRNA in cecum and in small intestine after LPS. Gentamicin can suppress LPS-driven TNF-alpha production in proximal tubule cells, likely by inhibiting its translation. Overall preservation of protein synthesis and comparable MCP-1 suppression suggest a semiselective blockade within the LPS inflammatory mediator cascade. These results, coupled with increases in gut TNF-alpha/MCP-1 mRNAs, imply that gentamicin may exert protean, countervailing actions on systemic cytokine/chemokine production during gram-negative sepsis.",

Here we report recurrent mutations and deletions involving multiple components of the cohesin complex, including STAG2, RAD21, SMC1A and SMC3, in different myeloid neoplasms. These mutations and deletions were mostly mutually exclusive and occurred in 12.1% (19/157) of acute myeloid leukemia, 8.0% (18/224) of myelodysplastic syndromes, 10.2% (9/88) of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 6.3% (4/64) of chronic myelogenous leukemia and 1.3% (1/77) of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms. Cohesin-mutated leukemic cells showed reduced amounts of chromatin-bound cohesin components, suggesting a substantial loss of cohesin binding sites on chromatin. The growth of leukemic cell lines harboring a mutation in RAD21 (Kasumi-1 cells) or having severely reduced expression of RAD21 and STAG2 (MOLM-13 cells) was suppressed by forced expression of wild-type RAD21 and wild-type RAD21 and STAG2, respectively. These findings suggest a role for compromised cohesin functions in myeloid leukemogenesis. ",

    "title": "A causal role for uric acid in fructose-induced metabolic syndrome. ",
    "abstract": "The worldwide epidemic of metabolic syndrome correlates with an elevation in serum uric acid as well as a marked increase in total fructose intake (in the form of table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup). Fructose raises uric acid, and the latter inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability. Because insulin requires nitric oxide to stimulate glucose uptake, we hypothesized that fructose-induced hyperuricemia may have a pathogenic role in metabolic syndrome. Four sets of experiments were performed. First, pair-feeding studies showed that fructose, and not dextrose, induced features (hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperuricemia) of metabolic syndrome. Second, in rats receiving a high-fructose diet, the lowering of uric acid with either allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) or benzbromarone (a uricosuric agent) was able to prevent or reverse features of metabolic syndrome. In particular, the administration of allopurinol prophylactically prevented fructose-induced hyperinsulinemia (272.3 vs.160.8 pmol/l, P &lt; 0.05), systolic hypertension (142 vs. 133 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05), hypertriglyceridemia (233.7 vs. 65.4 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.01), and weight gain (455 vs. 425 g, P &lt; 0.05) at 8 wk. Neither allopurinol nor benzbromarone affected dietary intake of control diet in rats. Finally, uric acid dose dependently inhibited endothelial function as manifested by a reduced vasodilatory response of aortic artery rings to acetylcholine. These data provide the first evidence that uric acid may be a cause of metabolic syndrome, possibly due to its ability to inhibit endothelial function. Fructose may have a major role in the epidemic of metabolic syndrome and obesity due to its ability to raise uric acid.",

    "title": "Stroke and long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution from nitrogen dioxide: a cohort study. ",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Years of exposure to tobacco smoke substantially increase the risk for stroke. Whether long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution can lead to stroke is not yet established. We examined the association between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and incident and fatal stroke in a prospective cohort study. METHODS: We followed 57,053 participants of the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort in the Hospital Discharge Register for the first-ever hospital admission for stroke (incident stroke) between baseline (1993-1997) and 2006 and defined fatal strokes as death within 30 days of admission. We associated the estimated mean levels of nitrogen dioxide at residential addresses since 1971 to incident and fatal stroke by Cox regression analyses and examined the effects by stroke subtypes: ischemic, hemorrhagic, and nonspecified stroke. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 9.8 years of 52,215 eligible subjects, there were 1984 (3.8%) first-ever (incident) hospital admissions for stroke of whom 142 (7.2%) died within 30 days. We detected borderline significant associations between mean nitrogen dioxide levels at residence since 1971 and incident stroke (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99-1.11, per interquartile range increase) and stroke hospitalization followed by death within 30 days (1.22; 1.00-1.50). The associations were strongest for nonspecified and ischemic strokes, whereas no association was detected with hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution may contribute to the development of ischemic but not hemorrhagic stroke, especially severe ischemic strokes leading to death within 30 days.",

    "abstract": "The new bispyridinium oximes HI 6 and HLo 7 are promising antidotes against poisoning by highly toxic organophosphorus compounds, i.e. nerve agents. Until now, their ability to reactivate pesticide inhibited human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has not been elucidated. For this purpose human erythrocyte AChE (EC 3.1.1.7) was inhibited (30 min) by chlorfenvinphos, dichlorvos, dicrotophos, heptenophos, mevinphos, monocrotophos, paraoxon, phosphamidon, trichlorfon, malaoxon, omethoate, oxydemeton-methyl or methamidophos by 85-98% of control. After removal of excess inhibitor, obidoxime, pralidoxime (2-PAM), HI 6 or HLo 7 (10, 30 or 100 mumol/l) were added and the AChE activity was measured spectrophotometrically at various times thereafter (5-60 min). The oximes significantly, but not completely, reactivated organophosphate inhibited AChE. The velocity and extent of reactivation were dependent on the oxime and its concentration. In all cases obidoxime was superior to the three other oximes, followed by HLo 7, 2-PAM and HI 6. In most cases obidoxime and HLo 7 were most effective at 10 or 30 mumol/l while 2-PAM and HI 6 needed 100 mumol/l. These data suggest that 2-PAM HI 6 and HLo 7 are less patent than obidoxime in reactivating human AChE inhibited by organophosphate pesticides.",

    "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide is a known bladder carcinogen, with cumulative dose directly related to increased risk. There is no consensus, however, on which major cyclophosphamide metabolite (i.e., acrolein or phosphoramide mustard) drives bladder carcinogenesis. We examined 19 cyclophosphamide-related bladder tumors to test the hypothesis that they might contain somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene that could link a specific metabolite to the etiology of these cancers. Forty-three % (9 of 19) of the cases had a mutation in p53, with a predominance at G:C bp (7 of 9, 77%), a preference for non-CpG sites (6 of 7, 86%), and frequent G:C--&gt;A:T transitions (5 of 7, 71%). The p53 mutation spectrum of these cyclophosphamide-associated bladder cancers differed significantly from patterns reported for sporadic (P = 0.020), smoking-related (0.043), and schistosomiasis-linked (P = 0.002) tumors but not arylamine-associated neoplasms (P = 0.860). Differences between the cyclophosphamide and arylamine-associated spectra included an unusual degree of clustering of exon 6 mutations (43% versus 17%, respectively) and an absence of multiple mutations in the former. Notably lacking in our series were G:C--&gt;T:A transversions, the principal mutation associated with acrolein. Instead, the mutation spectrum matches the phosphoramide mustard adduction sequences determined by a repetitive primer-extension assay (P = 0.024), indicating that this metabolite might be a key mutagen in cyclophosphamide-related bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "The nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) 1-, 2-, and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene, 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[e]pyrene, 2- and 3-nitrofluoranthene, 9-nitrodibenz[a,c]anthracene, and two of the parent PAHs fluoranthene and dibenz[a,c]anthracene were tested for tumorigenicity in the neonatal male B6C3F1 mouse. 6-Nitrochrysene was used as a positive control. Mice were administered three intraperitoneal injections of test agent (400 nmol total) on 1, 8, and 15 days after birth and evaluated for liver and lung tumors at 12 months of age. 2-Nitrobenzo[a]pyrene and 6-nitrochrysene induced a high incidence of liver tumors (91-100%), while the remaining test compounds did not induce tumors at a rate significantly higher than the solvent control. 6-Nitrochrysene was the only test agent to produce a significant increase in the frequency of lung tumors. K- and H-ras mutations were analyzed in liver tumors of treated mice and mainly occurred at the first base of K-ras codon 13, resulting in GGC --&gt; CGC transversion. Since most of the tested nitro-PAHs are mutagens in vitro, the results of this study indicate that the in vitro mutagenicity of these compounds does not correlate with their tumorigenicity in the neonatal B6C3F1 mouse bioassay. Also, the results indicate that liver tumors from mice treated with nitro-PAHs possess ras mutations typical of PAHs and their derivatives.",

Mortality rates from ISHD among residents in 60 villages of the area in Taiwan with endemic arseniasis from 1973 through 1986 were analyzed to examine their association with arsenic concentration in drinking water. Based on 1 355 915 person-years and 217 ISHD deaths, the cumulative ISHD mortalities from birth to age 79 years were 3.4%, 3.5%, 4.7%, and 6.6%, respectively, for residents who lived in villages in which the median arsenic concentrations in drinking water were &lt;0.1, 0.1 to 0.34, 0.35 to 0.59, and &gt; or = 0.6 mg/L. A cohort of 263 patients affected with blackfoot disease (BFD), a unique arsenic-related peripheral vascular disease, and 2293 non-BFD residents in the endemic area of arseniasis were recruited and followed up for an average period of 5.0 years. There was a monotonous biological gradient relationship between cumulative arsenic exposure through drinking artesian well water and ISHD mortality. The relative risks were 2.5, 4.0 and 6.5, respectively, for those who had a cumulative arsenic exposure of 0.1 to 9.9, 10.0 to 19.9, and &gt; or = 20.0 mg/L-years compared with those without the arsenic exposure after adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, body mass index, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and disease status for hypertension and diabetes through proportional-hazards regression analysis.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The prototypical atypical antipsychotic agent, clozapine, is more efficacious for refractory schizophrenia than the 'typical' antipsychotics, but the mechanism underlying this enhanced efficacy is still under investigation. Since 2002, at least 22 association studies have shown that the DTNBP1 can be associated with the risk for schizophrenia. We hypothesized that DTNBP1 might also influence the response to antipsychotic treatments. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the DTNBP1 and the effects of clozapine and haloperidol on refractory schizophrenia. METHODS: Patients with refractory schizophrenia were assigned to clozapine (n=85) or haloperidol (n=96) and followed for 3 months. Symptom improvement was evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score. Six markers at DTNBP1 and 38 ancestry-informative markers were genotyped in all participants. The relationships between the effects of antipsychotics and the diplotypes, haplotypes, genotypes, and alleles of DTNBP1 were tested by analysis of covariance, analysis of variance, and t-test. RESULTS: Patients with diplotype ACCCTC/GTTGCC, genotypes T/T+T/C, or allele T of marker rs742105 (P1333) have better response to clozapine (0.005&lt; or =P&lt; or =0.049), and patients with diplotype ACCCTC/GCCGCC, genotype A/G, or allele A of marker rs909706 (P1583) have better response to haloperidol (0.007&lt; or =P&lt; or =0.080) in European-Americans, African-Americans, and/or the combined sample; European-American patients with diplotype ACCCTC/GCCGCC have worse response to clozapine on positive symptoms (P=0.011). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the DTNBP1 gene modulates the effects of both the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. Participants with different DTNBP1 diplotypes, haplotypes, genotypes, or alleles might have different responses to these antipsychotics.",

METHODS: We present the clinical findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies in a woman with hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and a palsy of cranial nerve VI, associated with cocaine-induced destruction of her nasal and paranasal structures and the anterior base of her skull. RESULTS: A 55-year-old woman, a long-term cocaine abuser, presented with delirium, nausea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and hypotension as manifestations of adrenal insufficiency (cortisol levels &lt;1 mg/dL before and after administration of cosyntropin). She was found to have a deficiency of adrenocorticotropic hormone (&lt;1 pg/mL), gonadotropin deficiency (estradiol &lt;20 pg/mL, luteinizing hormone 1.7 mIU/mL, and follicle-stimulating hormone 4.9 mIU/mL), and diabetes insipidus. She also had a palsy of right cranial nerve VI. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head demonstrated extensive destruction of the paranasal sinuses, extending into the base of the skull. Serial magnetic resonance images showed reduction of pituitary volume. Nasal biopsy specimens disclosed findings consistent with cocaine-induced ischemic necrosis. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus due to prolonged intranasal cocaine abuse.",

The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained LiCl (60 mmol/kg) for 4 weeks developed marked polyuria. The Li-treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentrations. Plasma sodium concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the Li-treated rats compared with those in controls. Plasma concentration of AVP and transcripts of AVP gene in the PVN and SON were significantly increased in the Li-treated rats compared with controls. These results suggest that dehydration and/or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma AVP and the upregulation of AVP gene expression in the PVN and the SON of the Li-induced diabetes insipidus rat.",

    "abstract": "Chronic and excessive ethanol consumption is known to alter neuron and glial cell functions in the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes comprise the major cell type in the brain. These immune active cells are capable of responding to proinflammatory cytokines and endotoxins, which stimulate transcriptional pathways leading to induction of genes, including the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). In this study, we investigate the effects of ethanol on cytokine-induced iNOS and sPLA2 in immortalized astrocytes (DITNC). When DITNC cells were exposed to ethanol (0-200 mM) for 4 h prior to subsequent stimulation with cytokines for 16 h, NO production decreased with increasing ethanol concentrations starting from 50 mM. At ethanol concentrations higher than 100 mM, ethanol also inhibited cytokine-induced sPLA2 release into the culture medium. The inhibitory effect of ethanol on NO production corresponds well with the decrease in iNOS protein and NOS enzyme activity, but not with iNOS and sPLA2 mRNA nor binding of NF-kappaB to DNA. The inhibition of cytokine-induced NO production by ethanol was also dependent on the time of ethanol exposure to the cells, but addition of acetaldehyde up to 200 microM did not elicit any changes. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a posttranscriptional mode of ethanol action on the cytokine induction pathway for NO production in astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Induction of expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been studied in primary cultures of chick embryo liver cells and in the LMH line of avian hepatoma cells. Cells were transiently transfected with selected constructs containing portions of the 5'-untranslated (promoter) region of the HO-1 gene linked to luciferase as reporter gene. LMH cells that had been stably transfected with selected wild type or mutant constructs were also studied. Metalloporphyrins, especially Fe protoporphyrin (heme) and Co protoporphyrin strongly induced luciferase expression in both types of transfected cells. Low concentrations of Zn mesoporphyrin, an inhibitor of HO activity, exerted a synergistic effect on heme-, but not Co protoporphyrin-dependent induction. The antioxidant and &amp;bond;SH donor N-acetyl cysteine had little effect on the metalloporphyrin-dependent inductions of HO-1, in contrast to its marked inhibitory effect on the sodium arsenite-dependent induction of the HO-1 gene. Deletional analysis showed that the key element(s) required for the metalloporphyrin-dependent induction of HO-1 is located between -3.6 and -5.6 kb upstream of the transcription starting point. Data from electrophoretic mobility shift and site-directed mutagenesis experiments excluded a role for consensus AP-1 binding elements at -1576, -3647, or -4578 in the inductions produced by heme or Co protoporphyrin.",

    "abstract": "18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (18beta-GA) is a bioactive component of licorice with promising hepatoprotective activity. However, its protective mechanism on methotrexate (MTX) hepatotoxicity in not well defined. We investigated the hepatoprotective effect of 18beta-GA, pointing to the role of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and the redox-sensitive nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Wistar rats were orally administered 18beta-GA (50 and 100 mg/kg) 7 days either before or after MTX injection. MTX induced significant increase in circulating liver function marker enzymes and bilirubin with concomitant declined albumin levels. Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, and liver malondialdehyde and nitric oxide were significantly increased in MTX-induced rats. Treatment with 18beta-GA significantly reduced serum enzymes of liver function, bilirubin and pro-inflammatory cytokines. 18beta-GA attenuated MTX-induced oxidative stress and restored the antioxidant defenses. In addition, 18beta-GA improved liver histological structure and decreased the expression of Bax whereas increased Bcl-2 expression. MTX-induced rats showed significant down-regulation of Nrf2, hemoxygenase-1 and PPARgamma, an effect that was markedly reversed by 18beta-GA supplemented either before or after MTX. In conclusion, 18beta-GA protected against MTX-induced liver injury, possibly by activating Nrf2 and PPARgamma, and subsequent attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Therefore, 18beta-GA can provide protection against MTX-induced hepatotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the Na-K ATPase, has been shown to exert immunosuppressive effects. The goals of this study were to define the stage of the proliferative response which is sensitive to ouabain and to correlate the inhibitory action of ouabain on cell proliferation with its effect on Na-K ATPase activity. We found that ouabain inhibited T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and this inhibition was similar in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. To define the role of the Na-K ATPase in early activation of T lymphocytes, we examined the effects of ouabain on the induction of competence (acquisition of responsiveness to interleukin (IL)-2 or IL-4) by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or the combination of phorbol dibutyrate/ionomycin. Ouabain, at concentrations that completely inhibited the enzyme activity, did not interfere with the induction of competence, suggesting that although activated cells express increased activity of Na-K ATPase, this enzyme activity does not play a role in early activation pathways. In contrast, ouabain inhibited the progression phase to DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner even at concentrations that had little or no effect on Na-K ATPase activity. This inhibition was not due to a decrease in the production of IL-2 but rather to an inhibition of the expression of the p55 and p75 subunits of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). The inhibition of p55 appeared to occur at the mRNA level. These results indicate that the activity of the Na-K ATPase is not essential for the induction of competence or early activation. On the other hand, inhibition of cell proliferation and transcription of IL-2R subunits by low concentrations of ouabain may be related to changes in intracellular K+ concentrations or to inhibition of membranal phospholipid metabolism secondary to alteration in Na-K ATPase activity.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and motor cortex. It has been shown that 15-20% of patients with familial ALS (FALS) have defects in the Sod1 gene that encodes Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). To elucidate the pathological role of mutated Cu, Zn-SODs in FALS, the susceptibility of mutants to glycation was examined. Mutated Cu, Zn-SODs (G37R, G93A, and I113T) related to FALS and wild type were produced in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Glycated and nonglycated proteins were separated on a boronate column, and the nonglycated fraction was then incubated with glucose. The mutated Cu, Zn-SODs were found to be highly susceptible to glycation compared with the wild-type enzyme as estimated by Western blot analysis using an anti-hexitol lysine antibody. The mutated Cu, Zn-SOD incubated with glucose generated higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than the wild-type enzyme. Mutated Cu, Zn-SODs were also shown to be highly susceptible to fructation, and the fructated mutant also produced higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than the wild type. These results suggest that high susceptibility of mutated Cu, Zn-SODs to glycation could be the origin of the oxidative stress associated with neuronal dysfunction in FALS.",

    "abstract": "The nonsteroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used anticancer drug. In women with breast cancer, adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen reduces relapse and improves overall survival. In advanced breast cancer, the response rate is more than 50% in hormonal dependent disease. In women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen the incidence of new primary breast cancers is decreased. This latter observation has led to the initiation of prevention trials. In 1989 the first report from a large prospective randomised trial showed a significant increase of endometrial carcinoma among women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. This effect may be linked to the somewhat paradoxical estrogenic properties of tamoxifen. The endometrial effects should be considered in the long term use of tamoxifen, and should also be taken into account in the evaluation of the prevention trials. Animal data indicate that tamoxifen can induce tumours in other organ systems, for example the liver, but no increase in primary liver cancer has been reported from the randomised trials. In some of these trials an increase in other gastrointestinal cancers (e.g. colon and gastric carcinoma) has been observed. The mechanism behind this may be different from that of the endometrium. In animal systems, tamoxifen has shown to induce DNA damage, with formation of DNA adducts. The risk of secondary gastrointestinal cancer needs to be further evaluated. The adverse effects of tamoxifen have led to the development of new anti-estrogenic drugs and other estrogen reducing agents (e.g. aromatase inhibitors).",

In both groups, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was reduced to 60 mmHg by intravenous administration of ATP. During hypotensive anesthesia, coronary blood flow, myocardial blood flow and cardiac index increased significantly in both groups. Lactic acid and uric acid increased significantly during hypotensive anesthesia in the group 1. Heart rate, MAP, systemic vascular resistance and coronary vascular resistance decreased significantly during hypotensive anesthesia in both groups. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and central venous pressure showed no significant changes in both groups. Base excess in the group 1 increased markedly compared with the group 2. We conclude that pretreatment with dipyridamole can prevent metabolic acidosis that occurs during hypotensive anesthesia induced by ATP.",

    "abstract": "Casticin, a polymethoxyflavone, derived from natural plant Fructus Viticis exhibits biological activities including anti-cancer characteristics. The anti-cancer and alter gene expression of casticin on human colon cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Flow cytometric assay was used to measure viable cell, cell cycle and sub-G1 phase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ productions, level of mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim ) and caspase activity. Western blotting assay was used to detect expression of protein level associated with cell death. Casticin induced cell morphological changes, decreased cell viability and induced G2/M phase arrest in colo 205 cells. Casticin increased ROS production but decreased the levels of DeltaPsim , and Ca2+ , increased caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities. The cDNA microarray indicated that some of the cell cycle associated genes were down-regulated such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) (p21, Cip1) and p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 3 (PAK3). TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), CREB1 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 1) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) (p27, Kip1) genes were increased but matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), PRKAR2B (protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, regulatory, type II, bet), and CaMK4 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV) genes were inhibited. Results suggest that casticin induced cell apoptosis via the activation of the caspase- and/or mitochondria-dependent signaling cascade, the accumulation of ROS and altered associated gene expressions in colo 205 human colon cancer cells.",

Electrophysiological studies suggest that chorea is associated with abnormal synchronization of firing of basal ganglia neurons while dystonia is not. Levetiracetam is a novel anti-epileptic drug known to exhibit unique desynchronizing properties in contrast to other anti-epileptic drugs. We assessed the anti-dyskinetic efficacy of levetiracetam (13, 30 and 60 mg/kg, p.o.) administered in combination with an individually tailored dose of levodopa (Levodopa/carbidopa, 4:1 ratio, 19+/-1.8 mg/kg, p.o.), in six dyskinetic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned macaques. Levetiracetam (60 mg/kg) significantly reduced levodopa-induced chorea during the first hour post-treatment but had no effect on dystonia. Levetiracetam, at all doses tested, had no effect on the anti-parkinsonian action of levodopa. These results suggest that levetiracetam may provide a novel therapeutic approach specifically aimed at the choreic form of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Symptomatic visual field constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported. The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin-attributed visual field loss, three of whom were reported previously. Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin. METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken. RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field. The eighth exhibited concentric constriction. Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave. However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials. Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level. CONCLUSION: Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy. The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn.",

Kidney and mesentery of rats were perfused. In the short-term treated groups, there was no significant change in systolic blood pressure. The response to noradrenaline only in renal vascular beds was significantly increased by FK506 and this increase was prevented by Bosentan. FK506 had no significant effect on sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilation in comparison with solvent in both vascular beds. Bosentan failed to prevent these responses. In the long-term treated groups, at the end of the treatment with FK506, there was a significant increase in blood pressure, but no change in the response to noradrenaline in either kidneys or mesentery. The increase in blood pressure was prevented by bosentan treatment. FK506 increased malondialdehyde levels in the kidneys of the rats from only the long-term treated groups. Bosentan did not change this increase. Our results indicated that endothelin-1 plays a key role in the FK506-induced change in vascular reactivity to noradrenaline in renal vascular beds and drug-induced hypertension in the rats. There was no relationship between oxidative stress and FK506-induced hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists alleviate memory deficits caused by aging or by administration of beta-amyloid peptides in rodents, which is in accordance with the beneficial effects of caffeine consumption (an adenosine receptor antagonist) on memory performance in aged individuals and in preventing Alzheimer's disease. We now tested if A2A receptor blockade affords a general beneficial effect in different experimental paradigms disturbing memory performance in rodents. The beta-amyloid fragment present in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Abeta1-42, 2 nmol, icv) decreased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze after 15 days (29%) to an extent similar to the decrease of memory performance caused by scopolamine (2 mg/kg, ip) or MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg, ip) after 30 min (28% and 39%, respectively). The selective A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261 (0.05 mg/kg, ip every 24 h, starting 30 min before the noxious stimuli) prevented Abeta1-42-induced amnesia, but failed to modify scopolamine- or MK-801-induced amnesia. Similar conclusions were reached when testing another A2A receptor antagonist (KW6002, 3 mg/kg, ip). These results indicate that A2A receptors do not affect general processes of memory impairment but instead play a crucial role restricted to neurodegenerative conditions involving an insidious synaptic deterioration leading to memory dysfunction.",

Morphological changes were found in 57% of the male rats with lithium-induced uraemia after lithium administration for 16 weeks postnatally. The changes comprised myocytic degeneration and necrosis associated with infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes and plasma cells. This morphological picture is different from the myocardial changes associated with chronic renal failure. Male rats with chronic uraemia after withdrawal of lithium 8 weeks postnatally showed no myocardial changes after 16 weeks. Also, male rats with normal renal function had no myocardial changes after 16 weeks on lithium, but these rats had a significantly lower plasma level of lithium than the lithium-uraemic rats (0.8 vs. 1.4 mmol/l). It is suggested that myocarditis was a consequence of persistent high plasma levels of lithium maintained in the lithium-uraemic rats and that cardiotoxic effects of lithium may be potentiated by concomitant renal failure.",

    "abstract": "Ketanserin is a new strong antiserotoninergic drug that, unlike the previous ones, is selective for 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors. This drug has been employed successfully in the treatment of arterial hypertension and of some peripheral vascular diseases. The authors are carrying out a trial on medium term treatment with ketanserin (K) or propranolol (P) in comparison with placebo, to evaluate their effects on blood pressure, haemocoagulative parameters and peripheral circulation. The trial is a double-blind cross-over random trial on subjects with mild or moderate hypertension. Until now 13 patients have ended the study; six of them are suffering from arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs at 1st or 2nd stage according to Fontaine. Both propranolol and ketanserin significantly reduced the blood pressure, although the decrease in systolic blood pressure was more evident after propranolol. Heart rate diminished significantly only after propranolol administration. The noninvasive, intermittent (every 30 min) monitoring of blood pressure showed a significant 24-hour reduction of blood pressure after administration of propranolol or ketanserin without significant changes of circadian behaviour of the blood pressure. After administration of ketanserin a slight improvement in peripheral circulation was demonstrated, evaluated by using strain-gauge plethysmography. As regards the results obtained for platelet function and other haemocoagulative parameters examined, adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation, adenosine diphosphate slope, collagen lag period, antithrombin III biological activity, and serum fibrinogen did not show noticeable modifications after treatment, while beta-thromboglobulin levels decreased slightly after ketanserin administration.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) is a highly aggressive disease. Despite the use of various treatment regimens, the prognosis of NKTL is poor, and new treatment strategies need to be determined. Because of the significant survival potential, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB has become one of the major targets for drug development. In this study, we explored the effect and action mechanism of NF-kappaB inhibitors, BAY 11-7082 and curcumin, on NKTL cell lines (NKL, NK-92 and HANK1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that NF-kappaB was constitutively active in HANK1, a chemoresistant cell line. BAY 11-7082 and curcumin suppressed NF-kappaB activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which finally resulted in cell death. BAY 11-7082- and curcumin-induced cell death was associated with downregulation of Bcl-xL, cyclin D1, XIAP and c-FLIP, followed by caspase-8, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and activation. Given that the chemoresistant NK-92 cells respond to NF-kappaB inhibitors but not to conventional drugs, BAY 11-7082 and curcumin could be potentially useful for achieving improved outcome in chemotherapy-refractory NKTL.",

    "abstract": "The role of different isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the gastric mucosal hyperemia, induced by 155 mM luminal hydrochloric acid (pH approximately 0.8) without a barrier breaker, was investigated. Rats were anesthetized with Inactin (120 mg/kg ip), and mice were anesthetized with Forene (2.2% in 40% oxygen gas at 150 ml/min); the gastric mucosa was exteriorized. Gastric mucosal blood flow was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) in rats treated with Nomega-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA; unspecific NOS inhibitor), l-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine [l-NIL; inducible (i) NOS inhibitor], or S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline [SMTC; neuronal (n) NOS inhibitor], 10 mg/kg, followed by 3 mg. kg-1. h-1 iv, in iNOS-deficient (-/-) and nNOS(-/-) mice. mRNA was isolated from the gastric mucosa in iNOS(-/-) and wild-type (wt) mice, and real-time RT-PCR was performed. The effect of 155 mM acid on gastric mucosal permeability was determined by measuring the clearance of 51Cr-EDTA from blood to lumen. LDF increased by 48 +/- 13% during 155 mM HCl luminally, an increase that was abolished by l-NNA, SMTC, or l-NIL. In iNOS wt mice, LDF increased by 33 +/- 8% during luminal acid. The blood flow increase was attenuated substantially in iNOS(-/-) mice. RT-PCR revealed iNOS mRNA expression in the gastric mucosa in the iNOS wt groups. The blood flow increase in response to acid was not abolished in nNOS(-/-) mice (nNOS-sufficient mice, 39 +/- 18%; heterozygous mice, 25 +/- 19%; -/- mice, 19 +/- 7%). Mucosal permeability was transiently increased during 155 mM HCl. The results suggest that iNOS is constitutively expressed in the gastric mucosa and is involved in acid-induced hyperemia, suggesting a novel role for iNOS in gastric mucosal protection.",

    "abstract": "The objective of our study was to examine the changes in coagulation parameters and inflammatory reaction over the course of 15 days in patients with severe sepsis. We tried to identify mechanisms by which sepsis-induced pathophysiological changes may influence the effectiveness of subcutaneously (SC) administered enoxaparin 40 mg once daily. A total of 16 patients (8 men, 8 women; age 35-83 years) meeting the inclusion criteria of severe sepsis were enrolled in this study. The follow-up was performed on days 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 of hospitalization at the intensive care unit (ICU). Blood coagulation (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], prothrombin time [PT], fibrinogen, antithrombin (AT), protein C [PC], D-dimer, fragment 1.2 [F1.2], factor Xa [FXa] inhibition) and inflammatory reactants (interleukin 6 [IL-6], C-reactive protein [CRP], orosomucoid, alpha-1-antitrypsin) were tested. The mean FXa inhibition was 0.17 (+ or - 0.17) IU/mL. The arbitrarily established range of FXa inhibition for prophylaxis, 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL, was reached in 22 cases (20%), while in 74 cases (68%), it was below and in 13 cases (12%) above the aforementioned range. Factor Xa inhibition positively correlated with AT (r = .42; P &lt; .001) and PC (r = .45; P &lt; .001) activities. A negative correlation was found between the FXa inhibition and alpha-1-antitrypsin concentrations (r = -.33; P = .01) but only in the subgroup with alpha-1-antitrypsin concentrations &gt; or = 2.2 g/L. We confirmed that in most patients with sepsis, the prophylaxis with enoxaparin did not lead to the required FXa inhibition. The inhibition of FXa by enoxaparin depends mainly on the AT and PC activities.",

    "abstract": "Primaquine-induced hemolytic anemia is a toxic side effect that is due to premature splenic sequestration of intact erythrocytes. Previous studies have suggested that a phenolic metabolite, 5-hydroxyprimaquine (5-HPQ), mediates primaquine hemotoxicity by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) within erythrocytes that overwhelm antioxidant defenses. However, the nature of the oxidative stress is not understood, and the molecular targets, whether protein and/or lipid, are unknown. To investigate the mechanism underlying the hemolytic activity of 5-HPQ, we have examined the effect of hemolytic concentrations of 5-HPQ on ROS formation within rat erythrocytes using the cellular ROS probe, 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluoresein diacetate. In addition, we examined the effect of 5-HPQ on membrane lipids and cytoskeletal proteins. The data indicate that 5-HPQ causes a prolonged, concentration-dependent generation of ROS within erythrocytes. Interestingly, 5-HPQ-generated ROS was not associated with the onset of lipid peroxidation or an alteration in phosphatidylserine asymmetry. Instead, 5-HPQ induced oxidative injury to the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, as evidenced by changes in the normal electrophoretic pattern of membrane ghost proteins. Immunoblotting with an anti-hemoglobin antibody revealed that these changes were due primarily to the formation of disulfide-linked hemoglobin-skeletal protein adducts. The data suggest that cytoskeletal protein damage, rather than membrane lipid peroxidation or loss of phosphatidylserine asymmetry, underlies the process of removal of erythrocytes exposed to 5-HPQ.",

    "title": "Pharmacogenetic study of the impact of ABCB1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms on lenalidomide treatment outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma: results from a phase IV observational study and subsequent phase II clinical trial. ",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite therapeutic advances, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) continue to experience disease relapse and treatment resistance. The gene ABCB1 encodes the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, which confers resistance through drug extrusion across the cell membrane. Lenalidomide (Len) is excreted mainly via the kidneys, and, given the expression of P-gp in the renal tubuli, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ABCB1 gene may influence Len plasma concentrations and, subsequently, the outcome of treatment. We, therefore, investigated the influence of ABCB1 genetic variants on Len treatment outcomes and adverse events (AEs). METHODS: Ninety patients with relapsed or refractory MM, who received the second-line Len plus dexamethasone in the Rev II trial, were genotyped for the ABCB1 SNPs 1199G&gt;A (Ser400Asn, rs2229109), 1236C&gt;T (silent, rs1128503), 2677G&gt;T/A (Ala893Ser, rs2032582), and 3435C&gt;T (silent, rs1045642) using pyrosequencing, and correlations to response parameters, outcomes, and AEs were investigated. RESULTS: No significant associations were found between genotype and either best response rates or hematological AEs, and 1236C&gt;T, 2677G&gt;T or 3435C&gt;T genotypes had no impact on survival. There was a trend towards increased time to progression (TTP) in patients carrying the 1199A variant, and a significant difference in TTP between genotypes in patients with standard-risk cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a limited influence of ABCB1 genotype on lenalidomide treatment efficacy and safety. The results suggest that 1199G&gt;A may be a marker of TTP following Len treatment in standard-risk patients; however, larger studies are needed to validate and clarify the relationship.",

    "abstract": "A fluorescence polarization (FP) assay based on estrogen receptor was developed for the determination of bisphenol compounds (BPs). The human estrogen receptor alpha ligand binding domain (hERalpha-LBD) and coumestrol were employed as recognition element and fluorescent probe, respectively. Competitive displacement of tracer from receptor suggested that BPs exhibited dose-dependent binding to hERalpha-LBD. In order to elucidate the structural basis for the interaction between BPs and hERalpha-LBD, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore their complexation mechanism. The docked bisphenol compounds adopted agonist/antagonist conformations with varying positions and orientations in the hydrophobic binding pocket, depending on their structural characteristics of bridging moieties. Interestingly, the calculated binding energies were generally correlated with the experimentally measured affinities, indicating a potential advantage of the molecular modeling approach in predicting the binding potencies of putative ligands. Considering that the real samples may contain more than one BP, the established FP assay can potentially be used as a pre-screening method to determine the total amounts of bisphenol compounds.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: PD-0332991 is a selective inhibitor of the CDK4/6 kinases with the ability to block retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation in the low nanomolar range. Here we investigate the role of CDK4/6 inhibition in human ovarian cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the effects of PD-0332991 on proliferation, cell-cycle, apoptosis, and Rb phosphorylation using a panel of 40 established human ovarian cancer cell lines. Molecular markers for response prediction, including p16 and Rb, were studied using gene expression profiling, Western blot, and array CGH. Multiple drug effect analysis was used to study interactions with chemotherapeutic drugs. Expression of p16 and Rb was studied using immunohistochemistry in a large clinical cohort of ovarian cancer patients. RESULTS: Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of PD-0332991 were seen in all ovarian cancer cell lines, but varied significantly between individual lines. Rb-proficient cell lines with low p16 expression were most responsive to CDK4/6 inhibition. Copy number variations of CDKN2A, RB, CCNE1, and CCND1 were associated with response to PD-0332991. CDK4/6 inhibition induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, blocked Rb phosphorylation in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, and enhanced the effects of chemotherapy. Rb-proficiency with low p16 expression was seen in 97/262 (37%) of ovarian cancer patients and was independently associated with poor progression-free survival (adjusted relative risk 1.49, 95% CI 1.00-2.24, P = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: PD-0332991 shows promising biologic activity in ovarian cancer cell lines. Assessment of Rb and p16 expression may help select patients most likely to benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition in ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Chronic consumption of ethanol can cause cumulative liver damage that can ultimately lead to cirrhosis. To explore the mechanisms of alcoholic steatosis, we investigated the global intrahepatic gene expression profiles of livers from mice administered alcohol. Ethanol was administered by feeding the standard Lieber-DeCarli diet, of which 36% (high dose) and 3.6% (low dose) of the total calories were supplied from ethanol for 1, 2, or 4 weeks. Histopathological evaluation of the liver samples revealed fatty changes and punctate necrosis in the high-dose group and ballooning degeneration in the low-dose group. In total, 292 genes were identified as ethanol responsive, and several of these differed significantly in expression compared to those of control mice (two-way ANOVA; p&lt;0.05). Specifically, the expression levels of genes involved in hepatic lipid transport and metabolism were examined. An overall net increase in gene expression was observed for genes involved in (i) glucose transport and glycolysis, (ii) fatty acid influx and de novo synthesis, (iii) fatty acid esterification to triglycerides, and (iv) cholesterol transport, de novo cholesterol synthesis, and bile acid synthesis. Collectively, these data provide useful information concerning the global gene expression changes that occur due to alcohol intake and provide important insights into the comprehensive mechanisms of chronic alcoholic steatosis.",

    "title": "EGF-receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling are activated by benzo[a]pyrene 3,6-quinone and benzo[a]pyrene 1,6-quinone in human mammary epithelial cells. ",
    "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is activated by xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes to highly mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolites. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that benzo[a]pyrene quinones (BPQs), 1,6-BPQ and 3,6-BPQ, are able to induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cell signaling through the production of reactive oxygen species. Recently, we have reported that BPQs have the potential to induce the expression of genes involved in numerous pathways associated with cell proliferation and survival in human mammary epithelial cells. In the present study we demonstrated that BPQs not only induced EGFR tyrosine autophosphorylation, but also induced EGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1 and several signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The effects of BPQs were evaluated in a model of EGF withdrawal in MCF10-A cells. We found that BPQs (1 muM), induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation at positions Y845, Y992, Y1068, and Y1086. PLC-gamma1 phosphorylation correlated with the phosphorylation of tyrosine-Y992, a proposed docking site for PLC-gamma1 on the EGFR. Additionally, we found that BPQs induced the activation of STAT-1, STAT-3, STAT-5a and STAT-5b. STAT5 was shown to translocate to the nucleus following 3,6-BPQ and 1,6-BPQ exposures. Although the patterns of phosphorylation at EGFR, PLC-gamma1 and STATs were quite similar to those induced by EGF, an important difference between BPQ-mediated signaling of the EGFR was observed. Signaling produced by EGF ligand produced a rapid disappearance of EGFR from the cell surface, whereas BPQ signaling maintained EGFR receptors on the cell membrane. Thus, the results of these studies show that 1,6-BPQ and 3,6-BPQ can produce early events as evidenced by EGFR expression, and a prolonged transactivation of EGFR leading to downstream cell signaling pathways.",

In some cases, MTX-induced renal failure occurs which may not be prevented by the standard agent folin acid as a specific antidot. This results in a MTX-accumulation in the body tissue with subsequent massive toxic side effects. CASE REPORT: We report on a 62-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (first diagnosis November 1997) receiving chemotherapy with 2,340 mg methotrexate over 24 hours. After an increase of the MTX-plasma-level 36 hours following MTX-application, increased serum creatinine levels (maximum 5.07 mg/dl) were found. The application of folinic acid was without any significant effect. Fifty-six hours following MTX, 50 U/kg carboxypeptidase-G2 was infused. The MTX-plasma-level decreased rapidly and a recovery of renal function was monitored. CONCLUSION: CPDG2 may be highly effective in patients after development of an MTX-induced renal failure and delayed MTX-excretion.",

Although hyperuricemia is the most common side effect of MZ, there are no case reports of acute allograft renal failure associated with MZ. This report describes a patient who developed acute allograft renal failure and hyperuricemia during MZ treatment. Accordingly, MZ treatment was terminated, hemodialysis was initiated, and allopurinol was administered. Hemodialysis was necessary only once. The patient's condition improved with these treatments, and renal function recovered. Care should be taken during treatment with MZ to avoid latent renal dysfunction. Monitoring of serum uric acid levels was necessary. Moreover, it may be necessary to consider discontinuation of MZ and initiation of hemodialysis in cases of transient renal dysfunction. No prisoners were used and no organs from prisoners were used in the study.",

    "abstract": "1. Castor oil (2 ml orally) produced diarrhoea in rats 1-7 h after challenge, which was associated with gross damage to the duodenal and jejunal mucosa. 2. The injury was accompanied by release of acid phosphatase into the gut lumen, indicating cellular injury. 3. Intraperitoneal injection of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 2.5-50 mg kg-1 twice), prevented the diarrhoea. The dose of L-NAME (50 mg kg-1) completely blocked the diarrhoea but increased the release of acid phosphatase and worsened the gross damage. 4. The NO donating compound, isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IMN, 150 mg kg-1 twice) reversed the effects of L-NAME (50 mg kg-1) on castor oil-induced diarrhoea, gross damage and acid phosphatase release. 5. The apparent dissociation of the diarrhoeal and intestinal mucosal damaging effects of castor oil suggest that NO has a protective effect on the rat duodenal and jejunal mucosa, but that NO mediates, in part, the diarrhoea effect of this laxative.",

The resulting treated cells were then examined using human gene microarrays supplied by Agilent. These chips typically have somewhere on the order of 30,000 individual genes which are expressed in the human genome. For our study, this large list of genes was reduced to 205 principal genes thought to be important for skin and each individual ingredient was examined for its influence on the culled list of genes. Working on a hypothesis that there may be some common genes which are either upregulated or downregulated by all or most of these ingredients, a short list of genes for each cell line was developed. What appears to emerge from these studies is that several genes in the gene pool that was screened are influenced by most or all of the molecules of interest. Genes that appear to be upregulated in both cell lines by all the ingredients include: ACLY, AQP3, COX1, NOS3, and PLOD3. Genes that appear to be downregulated in both cell lines by all ingredients include only PGR.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Thalidomide and its more potent immunomodulatory derivative lenalidomide enhance rituximab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We therefore evaluated lenalidomide and rituximab in symptomatic Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) patients naive to either agent. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Intended therapy consisted of 48 weeks of lenalidomide (25 mg/d for 3 weeks and then 1 week off) along with rituximab (375 mg/m(2)/wk) dosed on weeks 2 to 5 and 13 to 16. Sixteen patients were enrolled, 12 of whom were previously untreated. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, we observed an acute decrease in hematocrit in 13 of 16 patients (median hematocrit decrease, 4.8%), which was attributable to lenalidomide patients and which led to cessation of further enrollment on this study. Lenalidomide-related anemia was observed even at doses as low as 5 mg/d and occurred in the absence of hemolysis or other cytopenias. The overall response and major response (&lt;50% decrease in serum IgM) rates were 50% and 25%, respectively, on an intent-to-treat basis. With a median follow-up of 31.3 months, 4 of 8 responding patients have progressed with a median time to progression of 18.9 months. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide produces unexpected but clinically significant acute anemia in patients with WM. In comparison with our previous study with thalidomide and rituximab in an analogous patient population, the responses achieved in WM patients with lenalidomide and rituximab appear less favorable.",

    "abstract": "Giant cell tumor of bone is an aggressive tumor characterized by extensive bone destruction and high recurrence rates. This tumor consists of stromal cells and hematopoietic cells that interact in an autocrine manner to produce tumoral osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. This autocrine regulation may be disrupted by novel therapeutic agents. Nonspecific local adjuvant therapies such as phenol or liquid nitrogen have been used in the treatment of giant cell tumor, but specific adjuvant therapies have not been described. The bisphosphonates pamidronate and Zoledronate can induce apoptosis in giant cell tumor culture in a dose-dependent manner. We established giant cell tumor cultures from patients with extensive destruction of bone. One of the four cultures formed osteoclastlike giant cells in vitro after more than six passages without exogenous receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand or macrophage colony stimulating factor. Annexin V staining, presence of active cleaved form of caspase-3, and disappearance of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase on Western blotting indicated activation of apoptosis by bisphosphonates in giant cell tumor. These results indicate that topical or systemic use of pamidronate or zoledronate can be a novel adjuvant therapy for giant cell tumor by targeting osteoclastlike giant cells, mononuclear giant cell precursor cells, and the autocrine loop of tumor osteoclastogenesis.",

Animal models suggest that when activated microglia are further activated by a subsequent systemic infection this results in significantly raised levels of interleukin 1beta within the CNS, which may in turn potentiate neurodegeneration. This prospective pilot study in Alzheimer's disease subjects showed that cognitive function can be impaired for at least two months after the resolution of a systemic infection and that cognitive impairment is preceded by raised serum levels of interleukin 1beta. These relations were not confounded by the presence of any subsequent systemic infection or by baseline cognitive scores. Further research is needed to determine whether recurrent systemic infections drive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease subjects through a cytokine mediated pathway.",

    "abstract": "GSTs from adult Drosophila melanogaster have been partially purified using three different affinity chromatography media and separated by 2-DE. Nine GSTs have been identified by MALDI-TOF MS. In the absence of special treatments, eight GSTs could be positively identified. These were DmGSTs D1 (the dominant Delta isoform which was present in five protein zones of differing pI) and D3 (and possibly also D5); the Epsilon-class GSTs E3, 6, 7 and 9 and a previously uncharacterised, probable member of the class, CG16936. The Sigma-class DmGSTS1 was prominent. DmGSTD2 was detected only after pretreatment of the flies with Phenobarbital (PhB). Treatment with Paraquat (PQ) led to an increase in the total GST activity, as measured with the substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 3,4-dichloro-nitrobenzene (DCNB) and an increase in the relative amounts of the D1, D3, E6 and E7 isoforms. PhB treatment led to increases in the relative amounts of the D1, D2, E3, E6, E7 and E9 isoforms detected with a possible depression in the relative amount of GSTS1. CG16936 was unaffected by either pretreatment.",

    "abstract": "Oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OPAHs) are byproducts of combustion and photo-oxidation of parent PAHs. OPAHs are widely present in the environment and pose an unknown hazard to human health. The developing zebrafish was used to evaluate a structurally diverse set of 38 OPAHs for malformation induction, gene expression changes and mitochondrial function. Zebrafish embryos were exposed from 6 to 120h post fertilization (hpf) to a dilution series of 38 different OPAHs and evaluated for 22 developmental endpoints. AHR activation was determined via CYP1A immunohistochemistry. Phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PHEQ), 1,9-benz-10-anthrone (BEZO), xanthone (XAN), benz(a)anthracene-7,12-dione (7,12-B[a]AQ), and 9,10-anthraquinone (9,10-ANTQ) were evaluated for transcriptional responses at 48hpf, prior to the onset of malformations. qRT-PCR was conducted for a number of oxidative stress genes, including the glutathione transferase(gst), glutathione peroxidase(gpx), and superoxide dismutase(sod) families. Bioenergetics was assayed to measure in vivo oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in 26hpf embryos exposed to OPAHs. Hierarchical clustering of the structure-activity outcomes indicated that the most toxic of the OPAHs contained adjacent diones on 6-carbon moieties or terminal, para-diones on multi-ring structures. 5-carbon moieties with adjacent diones were among the least toxic OPAHs while the toxicity of multi-ring structures with more centralized para-diones varied considerably. 9,10-PHEQ, BEZO, 7,12-B[a]AQ, and XAN exposures increased expression of several oxidative stress related genes and decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), a measurement of mitochondrial respiration. Comprehensive in vivo characterization of 38 structurally diverse OPAHs indicated differential AHR dependency and a prominent role for oxidative stress in the toxicity mechanisms. ",

The experimental exposure was done in locations with different air pollution profiles: a polluted area (downtown Sao Paulo) and a \"clean\" environment. Swiss mice were employed and urethane (3 g/kg) was used as a carcinogenic substance. All the animals, whether exposed or not to air pollution, were sacrificed after 6 months, and the lung lesions were analysed. The results showed a significant effect of air pollution on tumour progression, observed by changes in the phenotype of the tumour cells as demonstrated by morphometry and DNA ploidy. We observed more atypical adenomas in the air pollution-exposed group (p = 0.02). Coherently, morphometric differences were also detected between the two groups. Neoplasms of exposed mice exhibited an increase in the nuclear fraction (p = 0.002) and in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio (p = 0.011), as a decrease in the stromal fraction (p &lt; 0.001). There was a higher risk of aneuploidy in the 6-months-of-air-pollution-exposure group (relative risk: 1.58; 95% of confidence interval: 1.007 to 2.403). These results indicate that urban air pollution accelerates the process of progression towards malignancy.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Doxorubicin (Dox) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent associated with severe cardiotoxicity. Erythropoietin (Epo) has recently been shown to exhibit proangiogenic properties related to endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization. We tested the hypothesis that EPC are compromised in rats with Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and correction of this functional impairment by treatment with Epo could result in attenuation of myocardial dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wistar rats were either treated with two different doses of Epo (20U or 200U) or PBS (n = 40 in each group) for four consecutive weeks, followed by Dox administration. In a second study, EPC obtained from healthy rats were transfused intravenously (n = 20/group) prior to induction of Dox cardiomyopathy. EPC from healthy subjects were evaluated for their proliferative and migratory properties in the presence or absence of Dox and Epo pre-treatment. Echocardiography demonstrated an improvement in fractional shortening (FS) in Epo-treated rats. Epo treatment was associated with a reduced mortality in both Epo-treated groups. Circulating EPC numbers were three times higher in Epo-treated compared with non-treated animals. Adhesive properties, migration, and tube formation capacity in matrigel of EPCs from both Epo-treated groups as compared with controls were significantly enhanced. EPC transfer to Dox-treated rats led to functional myocardial improvement equivalent to the protection afforded by treatment with Epo. In EPC obtained from humans, pre-incubation with Epo significantly attenuated the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects of treatment with Dox. CONCLUSION: Epo treatment is potentially protective against myocardial dysfunction induced by Dox. These effects are partially mediated by enhancement in the number of EPC and their functional properties.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have shown that mental challenge under controlled experimental conditions is associated with elevations in inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, relatively little work has been done on the effects of 'naturalistic' stressors on acute changes in inflammatory markers. The present study examined whether perceived arousal, valence and dominance in musicians are associated with pro-inflammatory and oxidative responses to a concert situation. Blood and salivary samples obtained from 48 members of a symphony orchestra on the day of rehearsal (i.e., control situation) and on the following day of premiere concert (i.e., test situation) were used to determine changes in salivary cortisol, pro-inflammatory markers (plasma myeloperoxidase, serum CRP, plasma IL-6), oxidative stress markers (paraoxonase1 activity and malondialdehyde), and homocysteine, a risk factor for vascular disease. Results of regression analyses showed a significant trend to increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) response in individuals with low valence score. Both affective states, valence and arousal, were identified as significant predictors of cortisol response during concert. In addition, control levels of plasma malondialdehyde were positively correlated with differences in IL-6 levels between premiere and rehearsal (r=.38, p=.012), pointing to higher oxidative stress in individuals with pronounced IL-6 response. Our results indicate that stress of public performance leads to increased concentrations of plasma MPO (20%), IL-6 (27%) and salivary cortisol (44%) in musicians. The decreasing effect of pleasantness on the MPO response was highly pronounced in non-smokers (r=-.60, p&lt;.001), suggesting a significant role of emotional valence in stress-induced secretion of MPO. Additional studies are needed to assess the generalizability of these findings to other 'naturalistic' stress situations.",

    "abstract": "2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) has been shown to induce marked atrophic changes of exocrine pancreas of rats when given at 400 ppm in diet. On the other hand, 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) causes pancreatic acinar tumors. Both chemicals also induce intestinal tumors. In the present experiment, the possible promotional effects of PhIP on DMAB-induced carcinogenesis in the rat were investigated with particular attention given to the pancreas and intestine. After initiation with subcutaneous injections of DMAB (150 mg/kg b.w.) once a week for 3 weeks, PhIP was administered in the diet at doses of 200, 100, 25 and 0 ppm from weeks 5 to 40. In a dose-dependent manner, PhIP clearly increased the numbers of basophilic acinar foci and nodules while decreasing development of acidophilic lesions. The incidences of adenocarcinomas of the small intestine but not the colon demonstrated a tendency for an increase with the higher doses of PhIP. The results thus indicated that PhIP administration after DMAB treatment exerts two different effects on pancreatic acinar cell lesions, enhancing the growth of basophilic foci and suppressing that of their acidophilic counterparts. Any influence on alimentary canal tumorigenesis was limited to the small intestine.",

    "abstract": "Sixteen ASA 1 or 2 patients scheduled for abdominal surgery were included in the study after they had given their informed consent. Thirty minutes after starting a low-thoracic epidural anaesthesia (median level of sensitivity loss: T5), the patients were randomly given an intravenous bolus injection of either thiopentone (4 mg.kg-1, n = 8) or etomidate (0.5 mg.-1, n = 8), associated with succinylcholine 1 mg.kg-1. One minute after induction of general anaesthesia, the patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated (V(T) 8 ml.kg-1, rate 12 c.min-1). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (oscillometric method), cardiac output (CO) (transthoracic bioimpedance) and heart rate were recorded semi-continuously. Total peripheral resistances (TPR) were calculated using the formula TPR = (MA/CO)*80. There were no differences between the groups in patient age, height, weight, and cardiovascular consequences of epidural anaesthesia. After anaesthetic induction and before endotracheal intubation, there was a slight decrease in CO in both groups, without any change in MAP. After intubation, MAP increased in both groups through peripheral vasoconstriction, whereas CO did not increase further. A significant tachycardia was occurred only seen in the thiopentone group, before and after tracheal intubation. This study showed that thiopentone and etomidate were suitable drugs for anaesthetic induction in a patient under epidural blockade. However, the absence of tachycardia following etomidate may be beneficial in cardiac patients. The monitoring of cardiac output determinants during thiopentone and etomidate anaesthesia require further invasive investigations.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe an adverse effect with intravenous codeine in a chid diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. CASE SUMMARY: A seven-year-old boy with sickle cell anemia was admitted to the emergency department with severe pain unresponsive to high doses of oral acetaminophen; subsequently, intravenous codeine phosphate was administered. The patient immediately developed a tonic-clonic seizure, which was treated with intravenous diazepam and naloxone. DISCUSSION: Seizures associated with the intravenous administration of codeine phosphate have not been extensively reported in the literature, and special precautions for using the parenteral route for this drug have been vague and limited. Because of the frequent need for acute pain control in children with sicke cell crisis, they may be exposed to this type of reaction when intravenous narcotics are administered. The need for clear guidelines regarding the drug's appropriate parenteral dosing and administration is essential. CONCLUSIONS: Codeine phosphate-induced seizures are not common. The need for special instructions for its intravenous administration may prevent this type of reaction, especially in patients in need of acute pain control requiring intravenous narcotics.",

    "abstract": "Disrupted regulation and accumulation of bile salts (BS) in the liver can contribute towards progressive liver damage and fibrosis. Here, we investigated the role of BS in the progression of cholestatic injury and liver fibrosis using 3D scaffold-free multicellular human liver microtissues (MTs) comprising the cell lines HepaRG, THP-1 and hTERT-HSCs. This in vitro model has been shown to recapitulate cellular events leading to fibrosis including hepatocellular injury, inflammation and activation of HSCs, ultimately leading to increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). In order to better differentiate the contribution of individual cells during cholestasis, the effects of BS were evaluated either on each of the three cell types individually or on the multicellular MTs. Our data corroborate the toxic effects of BS on HepaRG cells and indicate that BS exposure elicited a slight increase in cytokines without causing stellate cell activation. Contrarily, using the MTs, we could demonstrate that low concentrations of BS led to cellular damage and triggered a fibrotic response. This indicates that cellular interplay is required to achieve BS-triggered activation of HSC. Moreover, BS were capable of down-regulating CYP7A1 expression in MTs and elicited abnormal lipid production (accumulation) concordant with clinical cases where chronic cholestasis results in hypercholesterolemia.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy, in a dose-escalation study, of exisulind (an oral sulphone metabolite of sulindac thought to induce apoptosis in malignant cells by inhibiting cGMP-phosphodiesterase) combined with docetaxel in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), as pre-clinical studies suggested activity against prostate cancer and synergy with cytotoxic agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with HRPC were treated with oral exisulind twice daily for 21-day cycles and intravenous docetaxel given for 1 h on the first day of each cycle. Three dose levels were assessed, combining exisulind 150 and 250 mg twice daily with docetaxel at 60 or 75 mg/m2. Toxicity was then evaluated using standard criteria. RESULTS: The recommended phase II dose was determined to be exisulind 250 mg and docetaxel 60 mg/m2, with escalation to 75 mg/m2 after cycle 1, as tolerated. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities among all patients were neutropenia (56%), infection (24%) and hyperglycaemia (18%). Twelve of 32 evaluable patients (38%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 23-55%) had a decline in PSA by at least half. Only four of 17 evaluable patients (95% CI, 1-47%) treated at the phase II dose level had such a decline in PSA. The median (95% CI) overall survival of all patients was 16 (12.9-19.7) months and median progression-free survival 4.7 (2.7-5.2) months. CONCLUSION: The combination of exisulind and docetaxel was tolerable in patients with HRPC. The PSA response rates do not suggest an improvement over historical data with single-agent docetaxel in this population.",

With BM 17.0744-a compound structurally unrelated to thiazolidinediones--antihyperglycemic and antihyperinsulinemic potency has been demonstrated in various animal models of type II diabetes. The antidiabetic effect is independent of the genetic background of the disease, gender, and animal species. The 24-hour blood glucose profile was dose- and time-dependently improved in ob/ob mice after a single and fourth oral administration of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/d. A dose-dependent reduction of hyperglycemia (10%, 15%, 28%, and 66%) was found in db/db mice after the fifth oral administration of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/d. Hyperinsulinemia was reduced dose-dependently in yellow KK mice by 1%, 24%, 34%, and 66% after the fifth oral administration of 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/d. Overall glucose metabolism was predominantly higher in euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies in obese fa/fa rats pretreated for 14 days with 10 mg/kg/d BM 17.0744. The data in diabetic and insulin-resistant animals suggest an improvement of insulin action that is supported by enhancement of insulin effects in vitro. There is no evidence of a risk for hypoglycemia in diabetic and metabolically healthy animals. Triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol were reduced in the serum of metabolically healthy rats, as well as serum lipids in db/db mice, which suggests this effect is independent of amelioration of the diabetic status. Lipid-lowering effects in diabetic and healthy animals show an additional property of BM 17.0744. Because of its antidiabetic and lipid-lowering potency, the substance is of great interest in treating the metabolic syndrome. Lipid decreases in rats are associated with a dose-dependent increase in carnitine acetyltransferase activity in the liver to about 100-fold (12.5 mg/kg/d). This together with hepatomegaly in small rodents may indicate peroxisomal proliferation, a phenomenon considered species-specific. Its relevance for humans is well documented for other classes of compounds including fibrates. Specific side effects of insulin sensitizers of the thiazolidinedione type, such as an increase in body weight and heart weight, could not be observed after 4-week oral application of BM 17.0744 in rats. In general, BM 17.0744 was well tolerated in the pharmacological dose range in all species tested.",

In addition, we described proteasome-mediated degradation of GR in COL-treated HeLa cells. While these effects were previously attributed to cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, this explanation is not applicable for nonproliferating cells such as human hepatocytes (HH). In the current study, we compared COL-mediated microtubule disruption and cell cycle arrest with selected GR functions in HeLa cells and HH as models of proliferating and quiescent cells, respectively. Microtubule disruption led to irreversible decrease in GR binding capacity and protein level in HeLa cells. None of the parameters was restored 24 hours after COL withdrawal. In contrast, dexamethasone (DEX) binding was increased in HH at the beginning of the treatment, with following transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The findings of these investigations emphasize the GR-signaling differences between primary and transformed cells.",

    "abstract": "Metformin lowers blood pressure in humans and in experimental animal models. To determine the mechanism of acute metformin-induced hypotension, we measured changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during metformin alone (0, 10, 50, 100 mg/kg i.v.; n = 10) and during concomitant alpha adrenergic (phentolamine, 5 mg/kg; n = 5), beta adrenergic (propranolol, 3 mg/kg; n = 6), muscarinic (atropine, 200 micrograms/kg; n = 7), ganglionic (hexamethonium, 30 mg/kg; n = 11), nitric oxide synthase (NG-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt, 15 mg/ kg; n = 9) and combination ganglionic plus alpha adrenergic plus beta adrenergic (n = 6) blockade in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Responses to metformin alone were also assessed in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 6). In SHRs, metformin elicited depressor responses accompanied by tachycardia (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, -26 +/- 3 mm Hg; delta HR, +49 +/- 12 bpm). Depressor responses in Wistar-Kyoto rats were significantly attenuated (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, -9 +/- 4 mm Hg; P &lt; .01). Hypotensive actions of metformin in SHRs were abolished and reversed into pressor responses by hexamethonium (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, +24 +/- 6 mm Hg), phentolamine (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, +62 +/- 10 mm Hg) and by combination ganglionic plus adrenergic (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, +62 +/- 10 mm Hg) blockade. Neither propranolol, atropine nor NG-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt affected hypotensive responses to metformin. We conclude that acute intravenous metformin administration decreases MAP by causing withdrawal of sympathetic activity. The increase in MAP uncovered by hexamethonium and phentolamine suggests that the original depressor response to metformin is buffered by mechanisms unrelated to the autonomic nervous system.",

    "abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ontogeny and subunit expression are altered during developmental lead (Pb2+) exposure. However, it is unknown whether these changes occur at the synaptic or cellular level. Synaptic and extra-synaptic NMDARs have distinct cellular roles, thus, the effects of Pb2+ on NMDAR synaptic targeting may affect neuronal function. In this communication, we show that Pb2+ exposure during synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons altered synaptic NMDAR composition, resulting in a decrease in NR2A-containing NMDARs at established synapses. Conversely, we observed increased targeting of the obligatory NR1 subunit of the NMDAR to the postsynaptic density (PSD) based on the increased colocalization with the postsynaptic protein PSD-95. This finding together with increased binding of the NR2B-subunit specific ligand [3H]-ifenprodil, suggests increased targeting of NR2B-NMDARs to dendritic spines as a result of Pb2+ exposure. During brain development, there is a shift of NR2B- to NR2A-containing NMDARs. Our findings suggest that Pb2+ exposure impairs or delays this developmental switch at the level of the synapse. Finally, we show that alter expression of NMDAR complexes in the dendritic spine is most likely due to NMDAR inhibition, as exposure to the NMDAR antagonist aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV) had similar effects as Pb2+ exposure. These data suggest that NMDAR inhibition by Pb2+ during synaptogensis alters NMDAR synapse development, which may have lasting consequences on downstream signaling.",

    "title": "Polymorphism in the ERCC2 codon 751 is associated with arsenic-induced premalignant hyperkeratosis and significant chromosome aberrations. ",
    "abstract": "In West Bengal, India more than 6 million people are exposed to high levels of arsenic through drinking water. Since, only 15-20% of the exposed individuals show arsenic-induced skin lesions, it is assumed that genetic variation might play an important role in arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity. Arsenic exposure often leads to the development of hyperkeratosis, the precursor of arsenic-induced skin cancer. ERCC2 (excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 2) is a nucleotide excision repair pathway gene, and its SNPs have been implicated in several types of epithelial cancers. We investigated the possible association of ERCC2 codon 751 A--&gt;C polymorphism (lysine to glutamine) with arsenic-induced hyperkeratosis and correlated ERCC2 genotypes with increased frequencies of chromosomal aberration to ascertain whether any genotype leads to sub-optimal DNA repair. For this association study, 318 unrelated arsenic exposed subjects (165 with hyperkeratosis and 153 without any arsenic-induced skin lesions), drinking water contaminated with arsenic to a similar extent, were recruited. Genotyping was done through PCR-RFLP procedure. Lys/Lys genotype was significantly over-represented in the arsenic-induced hyperkeratosis-exhibiting group [odds ratio (OR) = 4.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.75-8.23]. A statistically significant increase in both CA/cell and percentage of aberrant cells was observed in the individuals with AA genotype compared to those with AC or CC genotype combined (P &lt; 0.01) in each of the two study groups, as also, in the total study population. This study indicates that ERCC2 codon 751 Lys/Lys genotype is significantly associated with arsenic-induced premalignant hyperkeratosis and is possibly due to sub-optimal DNA repair capacity of the ERCC2 codon 751 Lys/Lys genotype.",

    "abstract": "Phenytoin (PHT) is a commonly used anticonvulsant drug. It has been reported that children exposed prenatally to PHT have brain malformations and psychomotor dysfunction. The neonatal development of the central nervous system (CNS) in mice corresponds to the last trimester in humans. To examine the neurotoxic effects of PHT on postnatal brain development, we administered PHT at doses of 10, 17.5, 25, or 35 mg/kg to newborn mice once a day during postnatal days (PD) 2-4. These dose levels result in plasma levels corresponding to the therapeutic ranges in humans. We measured the weight of total brain, cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem on PD 5 through 21, and examined early motor functions including head elevation, elevation of pelvis, pivoting, crawling, and righting reflex . Total brain weight, cerebral weight, and cerebellar weight in the group treated with 25 or 35 mg/kg were significantly reduced compared to controls from PD 5 to 21. Mice treated with PHT at 25 or 35 mg/kg showed decreased locomotor abilities and righting reflex on PD 5. In all phenytoin treatment groups, phenytoin levels in the brain were higher than those in the plasma on the third day of PHT treatment. We thus observed neurotoxic effects of PHT on postnatal brain development in mice. Our present data may provide useful implications for the management of PHT-induced developmental neurotoxicity and evaluation of psychomotor development in children exposed to PHT during the late fetal period.",

METHODS: Twenty seven patients with gout were included in a fenofibrate plus anti-hyperuricaemic agents combination study, and 25 in a losartan plus anti-hyperuricaemic agents combination study. Serum uric acid concentration, uric acid clearance, and 24 hour urinary uric acid excretion were measured before and two months after the addition of fenofibrate (300 mg once daily) or losartan (50 mg once daily) to anti-hyperuricaemic agents. RESULTS: Combination therapy of fenofibrate or losartan with anti-hyperuricaemic agents, which included benzbromarone (50 mg once daily) or allopurinol (200 mg twice a day), significantly reduced serum uric acid concentrations in accordance with increased uric acid excretion. CONCLUSION: A combination of fenofibrate or losartan with anti-hyperuricaemic agents is a good option for the treatment of gout patients with hypertriglyceridaemia and/or hypertension, though the additional hypouricaemic effect may be modest.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of bone turnover on glucose homeostasis, fat distribution and adipokine production during anabolic treatment with PTH. This is a parallel, randomized controlled, open label, trial. The randomization was done by computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Forty-six postmenopausal osteoporotic non-diabetic women were assigned to treatment with calcium and colecalcipherol with (24) or without (22) PTH 1-84. Patients were recalled after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of treatment and markers of bone turnover, glucose metabolism, adipokine secretion and fat distribution were analyzed. Markers of bone turnover and adipokines were measured by ELISA. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by an oral glucose load test and insulin resistance and secretion were calculated. Fat and lean mass were evaluated by anthropometric measures. The effect of treatment on measured variables was analyzed by repeated measure test, and its effect on glucose was also evaluated by mediation analysis after correction for possible confounders. Twenty patients in the calcium and vitamin D groups and 19 in the group treated with PTH 1-84 completed the study. There were no significance adverse events. Treatment with PTH increases osteocalcin, both total (OC) and undercarboxylated (uOC), and decreases blood glucose, without influence on insulin secretion, resistance and pancreatic beta cell function. Treatment with PTH does not influence fat distribution and adipokine production. The results of the mediation analyses suggest a total effect of PTH on blood glucose, moderately mediated by OC and to a less extent by uOC. Here we suggest that treatment with PTH influences glucose metabolism partially through its effect on bone turnover, without influence on insulin secretion, resistance, pancreatic beta cell function and fat mass.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory activities in macrophages by competition for transcriptional coactivators with some transcriptional factors, including NF-kappaB. In the present study the influence of PPARgamma activators on IFN-gamma-elicited macrophage stimulation and signaling cascades was investigated. The results show that IFN-gamma-induced inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene transcription, iNOS protein induction, and NO production are more sensitive to inhibition by 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15dPGJ(2)) than by the other two PPARgamma agonists, GW1929 and ciglitazone. Delayed addition of 15dPGJ(2) for 2 h resulted in reduced inhibition, suggesting action by 15dPGJ(2) on the upstream signaling cascades. Immunoblotting, DNA binding, and reporter gene assays consistently revealed the inhibitory ability of 15dPGJ(2), but not GW1929 or ciglitazone, on IFN-gamma-elicited signaling cascades, including tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus tyrosine protein kinase 2 and STAT1, DNA binding, and IFN regulatory factor-1 trans-activation of STAT1. These effects of 15dPGJ(2) were not abrogated by the PPARgamma antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, indicating the PPARgamma-independent actions. 15dPGJ(2) also attenuated IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in Hep3B hepatoma cells. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of reactive oxygen species on STAT1 signaling, STAT1 inhibition by 15dPGJ(2) was abrogated by N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. Furthermore, 15dPGJ(2)-induced inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and NO production still occurred in the presence of peroxovanadate, ruling out the action mechanism of 15dPGJ(2) on tyrosine phosphatase. Taken together, for the first time in this study we demonstrate that 15dPGJ(2) can inhibit cytokine-stimulated Janus kinase 2-STAT signaling through a PPARgamma-independent, reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism. These data provide a novel molecular mechanism of iNOS inhibition by 15dPGJ(2) and confirm its physiological role in anti-inflammation.",

    "abstract": "We report results of a hospital-based case control study of 137 consecutive patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia (AA) in participating hospitals over a 4-year period. Diagnoses were made by a single laboratory, subjects were age- and gender-matched to two controls and interviewed concerning previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents. Analysis was conducted on two distinct subgroups: severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and moderate aplastic anemia (MAA). In univariate regression models, the strongest associations were observed for exposure to benzene and SAA (OR=3.12, 95% CI=1.12-8.65) and life on a farm and MAA (OR=3.08, 95% CI=1.44-6.56). Benzene exposure did not show a strong dose-response relationship with either subtype. When accounting for all of the potential confounders we considered in conditional regression models, the previous relationships persisted. Other explanatory variables included hair-dye use for MAA and farm exposures, such as livestock for SAA, although most of these additional variables fell just short of statistical significance. Adjusted R-squared values were only 10% for each subtype, leaving 90% of AA occurrence unexplained. Our results suggest that: (a) benzene exposure is more strongly related to SAA than MAA, (b) farm and livestock exposures are related to both forms of AA, confirming some previous results, and (c) a large percentage of AA remains unexplained, which may indicate that individual susceptibility has a major influence on AA occurrence.",

RESULTS: Mean daily nasal symptom scores were significantly reduced with treatment. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline for eye symptoms. Most patients (more than 80%) achieved substantial control of their symptoms with budesonide. The most common nasal and non-nasal adverse events for both groups were epistaxis and headache. Turbuhaler was easier to use and more convenient to carry, had less of an unpleasant taste, and caused less nasal irritation than the aqua spray. More than twice as many patients preferred Turbuhaler to the aqua spray (69% versus 31%). Improvement in quality of life from baseline to clinic visits was statistically significant in both groups. CONCLUSION: Once daily use of 256 mg of budesonide aqua and 400 mg of budesonide Turbuhaler are equally safe and efficacious in the treatment of SAR. Patients preferred the budesonide powder formulation delivered via Turbuhaler two to one over the aqua formulation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the cardiac status of the long-term survivors and to estimate the incidence and the features of subclinical cardiotoxicity induced after conventional treatment with doxorubicin for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a group of patients who previously received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for lymphoma. Echocardiograms were performed at least 5 years after therapy with anthracyclines. Clinical cardiomyopathy was defined by the presence of clinical signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). Subclinical cardiomyopathy was defined by decrease of left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) without clinical signs of CHF. Cumulative dose of doxorubicin, male sex, older age, relapse, radiotherapy (mediastinal or total-body irradiation), autologous stem-cell transplantation, high-dose cyclophosphamide, and cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, familial history of cardiac disease, being overweight, and smoking history) were evaluated as potential risk factors for the development of cardiac dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 141 assessable patients (median age, 54 years; median cumulative dose of doxorubicin, 300 mg/m(2)), only one developed CHF. Criteria of subclinical cardiomyopathy were found in 39 patients. In multivariate analysis, factors that contributed to decreased FS were male sex (P &lt;.01), older age (P &lt;.01), higher cumulative dose of doxorubicin or association with another anthracycline (P =.04), radiotherapy (P =.04), and being overweight (P =.04). CONCLUSION: Cardiac abnormalities can occur in patients treated with doxorubicin for lymphoma in the absence of CHF, even in patients who received moderate anthracycline doses. Male sex, older age, higher dose of doxorubicin, radiotherapy, and being overweight were risk factors for the development of cardiomyopathy.",

    "title": "Anticonvulsant effect of flutamide on seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole: involvement of benzodiazepine receptors. ",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: There is some structural similarity between the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide (Flut) and benzodiazepines (BZDs). We evaluated the possible anticonvulsant effect and interaction of Flut with BZD receptors in common seizure models. METHODS: (a) Different groups of mice each were pretreated i.p. with Flut, and after 0.5 h, they received chemoconvulsants [pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), bicuculline, aminophylline, strychnine or kainic acid]. Latency and incidence of a clonic seizure were recorded. (b) Mice were pretreated i.p. with Flut, and after 0.5 h, transauricular electroshock was applied. Occurrence of a tonic seizure was observed. (c) Amygdala-kindled rats were pretreated i.p. with Flut, and 0.5, 1, or 2 h later, they were stimulated at afterdischarge threshold. Then the seizure parameters (afterdischarge duration, seizure severity, and stage 5 duration) were recorded. (d) The effect of Flut on clonic seizure threshold was determined by i.v. infusion of bicuculline or PTZ to different groups of Flut-receiving mice. To determine the possible interaction of Flut with BZD receptors, the flumazenil (FMZ)+Flut effect on clonic seizure threshold was compared with the effect of Flut. (e) Neurotoxicity of Flut was evaluated by rotarod test at 30 min after administration. RESULTS: Flut produced a dose-dependent anticonvulsant effect against PTZ-induced seizures [median effective dose (ED50), 67.0 mg/kg]. Moreover, Flut elevated the clonic seizure threshold induced by bicuculline or PTZ. FMZ reversed the effect of Flut on the threshold of PTZ seizures. A median toxic dose (TD50) value of 124.8 mg/kg was obtained for Flut. CONCLUSIONS: Flut both blocks PTZ-induced clonic seizures and elevates the threshold of PTZ or bicuculline-induced clonic seizures, through interaction with BZD receptors.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study cytotoxic effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on the human lens epithelium cells and to identify the biological mechanism for these effects. METHODS: In this experimental study, human lens epithelium cells (FHL124 cells) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The effects of As2O3 on FHL124 cells growth were tested by MTT, and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Gene changes were detected by real-time PCR (Taqman). As2O3-induced changes in cell calcium level were measured by real-time fluorometric single-cell digital imaging techniques after Fura-2 incorporation. RESULTS: As2O3 inhibited the growth of FHL 124 cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, given an IC50 value of 1.5 micromol/L. As2O3 induced apoptosis of FHL124 cells as showed by TUNEL assay. As2O3 provoked an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response identified through an up regulation of EIF2A, ERN1 and ATF6 (F = 8.51, P = 0.0005). As2O3 depleted the calcium store and consequently lead to a decrease of calcium signaling (P = 0.0018). Moreover, As2O3 had a moderate effect on the calcium influx pathway. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 inhibits the growth and induces apoptosis of human lens epithelium cells. As2O3 provokes an ER stress which could be the cause of apoptic processes.",

    "abstract": "The Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme family comprises a wide array of monooxygenases involved in the oxidation of endobiotic and xenobiotic molecules. The active site of a CYP enzyme contains an iron protoporphyrin center coordinated to a cysteine thiolate, and then, molecular oxygen is associated with the iron to be converted into dioxygen complex plus substrate. Reduction by CYP reductase expedites hydroxylation of the compound. In this oxidation reaction, insufficient oxygen molecules would affect enzyme catalysis. Nevertheless, biochemical data about CYP kinetics at low oxygen concentrations are not available. In this work, we present the results on the variation in rat liver microsomal CYP Vmax app and Km app under normal and hypoxic conditions. Using alkoxyresorufin molecules as substrates, the Vmax/Km ratios for resorufin production decreased from 426 to 393 for CYP1A1 and from 343 to 202 for CYP2B1 at a low oxygen concentration (4.1 ppm) compared to the ratios observed at a normal oxygen concentration (6.5 ppm). Additionally, the bacterial mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene and cyclophosphamide, decreased by 32% and 42%, respectively, at low oxygen concentrations. These results support the hypothesis that low oxygen availability is implicated in the low efficiency of substrate oxidation by CYP.",

In this experiment, we examined the effect of the chronic administration of these two taxanes in the Wistar rat using neurophysiological, neuropathological and morphometrical methods. Our results showed that both paclitaxel and docetaxel induced a significant, equally severe and dose-dependent reduction in nerve conduction velocity. On the contrary, the morphometric examination demonstrated that the effect on the nerve fibres was more severe after paclitaxel administration when the same schedule was used. However, the overall severity of the pathological changes was milder than expected on the basis of the neurophysiological results. Our results support the hypothesis that taxanes (and particularly docetaxel) may exert their neurotoxic effect not only on the microtubular system of the peripheral nerves, but also on other less obvious targets.",

    "abstract": "While the mechanisms underlying the marked sexual dimorphism in inflammatory diseases are not well understood, the sexually dimorphic sympathoadrenal axis profoundly affects the inflammatory response. We tested whether adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of human neutrophil function is sexually dimorphic, since neutrophils provide the first line of defense in the inflammatory response. There was a marked sexual dimorphism in beta(2)-adrenergic receptor binding, using the specific beta(2)-adrenergic receptor ligand, [(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol, with almost three times more binding sites on neutrophils from females (20,878 +/- 2470) compared to males (7331 +/- 3179). There was also a marked sexual dimorphism in the effects of isoprenaline, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, which increased nondirected locomotion (chemokinesis) in neutrophils obtained from females, while having no effect on neutrophils from males. Isoprenaline stimulated the release of a chemotactic factor from neutrophils obtained from females, but not from males. This chemotactic factor acts on the G protein-coupled CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) chemokine receptor, since an anti-CXCR2 antibody and the selective nonpeptide CXCR2 antagonist SB225002, inhibited chemotaxis produced by this factor. While interleukin- (IL-) 8 is a principal CXCR2 ligand, isoprenaline did not produce an increase in IL-8 release from neutrophils. IL-8-induced chemotaxis was inhibited in a sexually dimorphic manner by isoprenaline, which also stimulated release of a mediator from neutrophils that induced chemotaxis, that was inhibited by anti-CXCR2 antibodies. These findings indicate an important role for adrenergic receptors in the modulation of neutrophil trafficking, which could contribute to sex-differences in the inflammatory response.",

    "title": "Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 mediates 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2-induced expression of glutamate cysteine ligase expression via Nrf2 signaling in human breast cancer cells. ",
    "abstract": "15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) is a representative J-series cyclopentenone prostaglandin bearing an electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. In the present study, treatment of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with 15d-PGJ(2) caused the up-regulation of the glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) subunit, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. 15d-PGJ(2) treatment caused nuclear translocation and transactivation of Nrf2, a redox-sensitive transcription factor responsible for induced expression of antioxidant and other cytoprotective genes. siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 abrogated 15d-PGJ(2)-induced GCLC expression. Following 15d-PGJ(2) treatment, the intracellular GSH level was initially diminished but eventually enhanced even above the basal level. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) abolished the 15d-PGJ2-induced Nrf2 activation and GCLC expression. Pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA knockdown of Akt, the target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), attenuated 15d-PGJ(2)-induced Nrf2 activation and GCLC expression, and NAC treatment inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, and subsequently Nrf2 activation and GCLC upregulation. 9,10-Dihydro-15-PGJ2, a nonelectrophilic analogue of 15d-PGJ(2) that lacks the ability to form a conjugate with GSH, failed to induce activation of Akt and Nrf2 as well as ROS generation. These findings, taken all together, suggest that intracellular accumulation of ROS formed as a consequence of initial depletion of GSH can activate Akt, which in turn induces Nrf2 activation and subsequently the expression of GCLC, leading to the restoration of GSH. Interestingly, the extracellular GSH level was increased, concomitantly with the depletion of the intracellular GSH following 15d-PGJ(2) treatment. However, 15d-PGJ(2) was unable to influence both intra- and extra-cellular GSH levels when multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), the efflux pump for GSH conjugates, was blocked by its antagonist, MK571. Moreover, 15d-PGJ(2)-induced GCLC expression was attenuated by the MK571 and also by siRNA knockdown of MRP1, suggesting that MRP1 contributes to 15d-PGJ(2)-mediated up-regulation of GCLC by pumping out the 15d-PGJ(2)-GSH conjugate. It is speculated that 15d-PGJ(2), once effluxed through MRP, liberates from the GSH conjugate, and the free 15d-PGJ(2) re-enters the cell and forms the GSH conjugate again. In conclusion, MRP1 mediates Nrf2-dependent up-regulation of GCLC in 15d-PGJ(2)-treated MCF-7 cells, possibly via a putative recycling loop of 15d-PGJ(2)-GSH conjugation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cocaine use is associated with myocardial ischemia and infarction, but it is unclear whether this is only because of the acute effects of cocaine on heart rate, blood pressure, and vasomotor tone or whether accelerated atherosclerosis from long-term exposure to cocaine also contributes. METHODS: We sought to measure the association between cocaine exposure and coronary calcification, a marker for atherosclerosis, among participants in the CARDIA Study who received computed tomography scanning and answered questions about illicit drug use at the year 15 examination in 2000-2001. RESULTS: Among 3038 CARDIA participants (age 33-45 years, 55% women and 45% black), past cocaine exposure was reported by 35% and was more common among men, smokers, drinkers, and participants with less education. Powdered cocaine exposure was more common among whites, crack cocaine among blacks. Before adjustment, cocaine exposure was strongly associated with coronary calcification. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, family history, and habits, however, these associations disappeared: adjusted odds ratios for coronary calcification were 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.3) for 1 to 10, 1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.7) for 11 to 99, and 1.0 (95% CI 0.6-1.6) for &gt; or =100 lifetime episodes of cocaine use, in comparison with none. Sex, tobacco, and alcohol use appeared to be primarily responsible for the confounding we observed in unadjusted models. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of a causal relationship between long-term exposure to cocaine and coronary calcification and conclude that acute nonatherogenic mechanisms probably explain most cocaine-associated myocardial infarction.",

    "title": "An assessment of the safety and efficacy of sibutramine, an anti-obesity drug with a novel mechanism of action. ",
    "abstract": "Sibutramine is a combined serotonin(5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA)re-uptake inhibitor. Sibutramine works predominantly through its two pharmacologically active metabolites (i.e. primary and secondary amines) which induce marked weight loss by affecting both food intake and energy expenditure. It is able to enhance the physiological process of satiety, and to stimulate thermogenesis, increasing the efferent sympathetic activity to thermogenically active brown fat. There is a dose-related reduction in body weight in clinical trials with sibutramine, with weight loss up to 11% below baseline, which can last up to 18 months with continued treatment. When weight loss is induced with a very low calorie diet (VLCDL), patients randomized to the sibutramine treatment continued to lose weight over a 1 year period, reaching 15% below baseline, whereas the placebo-treated patients regained some weight. Sibutramine improves metabolic fitness, by decreasing the biochemical risk factors associated with obesity, such as plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, glucose and insulin, and increasing HDL-cholesterol. In controlled studies, 84% of sibutramine-treated patients reported side effects, most commonly including dry mouth, constipation and insomnia, compared with 71% of patients receiving placebo. A small increase in heart rate and blood pressure also occurs and persists for as long as treatment is continued, which, therefore, requires monitoring. Nevertheless, successful treatment of moderately hypertensive obese patients with sibutramine has been demonstrated without undue blood pressure problems and even a mean lowering of blood pressure associated with weight loss. Finally, sibutramine does not have the potential for abuse that is characteristic of amphetamine and it is indistinguishable from placebo in abuse potential studies.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, nanotechnology environmental health and safety (nanoEHS) is gaining attention. We previously found that silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) could induce vascular endothelial damage. However, the subsequent toxicologic response to SiNPs-induced endothelial damage was still largely unknown. In this study, we explored the inflammation-coagulation response and thrombotic effects of SiNPs in endothelial cells and zebrafish embryos. For in vitro study, swollen mitochondria and autophagosome were observed in ultrastructural analysis. The cytoskeleton organization was disrupted by SiNPs in vascular endothelial cells. The release of proinflammatory and procoagulant cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, PECAM-1, TF and vWF, were markedly elevated in a dose-dependent manner. For in vivo study, based on the NOAEL for dosimetry selection, and using two transgenic zebrafish, Tg(mpo:GFP) and Tg(fli-1:EGFP), SiNPs-induced neutrophil-mediated inflammation and impaired vascular endothelial cells. With the dosage higher than NOAEL, SiNPs significantly decreased blood flow and velocity, exhibiting a blood hypercoagulable state in zebrafish embryos. The thrombotic effect was assessed by o-dianisidine staining, showed that an increasing of erythrocyte aggregation occurred in SiNPs-treated zebrafish. Microarray analysis was used to screen the possible genes for inflammation-coagulation response to SiNPs in zebrafish, and the JAK1/TF signaling pathway was further verified by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. For in-deepth study, il6st was knocked down with specific morpholinos. The whole-mount in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression jak1 and f3b were attenuated in il6st knockdown groups. In summary, our data demonstrated that SiNPs could induce inflammation-coagulation response and thrombotic effects via JAK1/TF signaling pathway.",

TGF-beta1 and adhesion molecules importantly function for adhesion of endometrial tissue fragments to mesothelium outside uterus. However, the function of TGF-beta1 on the regulation of adhesion molecule expression for adhesion of endometrial tissue fragments to mesothelium has not been fully elucidated. Interestingly, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression was higher in endometriotic epithelial cells than in normal endometrial cells. The adhesion efficiency of endometriotic epithelial cells to mesothelial cells was also higher than that of normal endometrial cells. Moreover, TGF-beta1 directly induced the adhesion of endometrial cells to mesothelial cells through the regulation of integrin of alphaV, alpha6, beta1, and beta4 via the activation of the TGF-beta1/TGF-betaRI/Smad2 signaling pathway. Conversely, the adhesion of TGF-beta1-stimulated endometrial cells to mesothelial cells was clearly reduced following treatment with neutralizing antibodies against specific TGF-beta1-mediated integrins alphaV, beta1, and beta4 on the endometrial cell membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-beta1 may act to promote the initiation of endometriosis by enhancing integrin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. [BMB Reports 2017; 50(8): 429-434].",

    "abstract": "Pb (lead) exposure and stress are co-occurring risk factors (particularly in low socioeconomic communities) that also act on common biological substrates and produce common adverse outcomes, including cognitive impairments. This study sought to determine whether lifetime Pb exposure combined with prenatal stress would enhance the cognitive deficits independently associated with each of these risk factors and to explore associated mechanisms of any observed impairments. Learning was evaluated using a multiple schedule of repeated learning and performance in female rats subjected to lifetime Pb exposure (0 or 50 ppm Pb in drinking water beginning in dams 2 months prior to breeding; blood Pb levels ~10 mug/dl), to prenatal restraint stress on gestational days 16 and 17, or to both. Blood Pb, corticosterone levels, brain monoamines, and hippocampal nerve growth factor levels were also measured. Sequence-specific learning deficits produced by Pb, particularly the number of responses to correctly learn response sequences, were further enhanced by stress, whereas performance measures were unimpaired. Statistical analyses indicated significant relationships among corticosterone levels, frontal cortex dopamine (DA), nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover, and total responses required to learn sequences. This study demonstrates that Pb and stress can act together to produce selective and highly condition-dependent deficits in learning in female rats that may be related to glucocorticoid-mediated interactions with mesocorticolimbic regions of brain. These findings also underscore the critical need to evaluate toxicants in the context of other risk factors pertinent to human diseases and disorders.",

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-six cases of gouty arthritis were divided into three groups randomly, 58 cases in traditional Chinese drug (TCD)-treated group, 56 cases in Western medicine (WM)-treated group and 52 cases in TCD plus WM-treated group. They were all treated for 12 weeks. In the acute stage, patients in TCD-treated group were treated with Huzhang Gout Granule and Jinhuang Ointment, and patients in WM-treated group were treated with diclofenac sodium dual release enteric-coated capsules. In the intermission, patients in TCD-treated group were given Yinlian Gout Granule, and patients in WM-treated group were given benzbromarone or allopurinol. Patients in TCD plus WM-treated group were given both TCD and WM. Clinical symptom score and blood uric acid (BUA) level were measured. The effect initiating time, relapse rate, efficacy rate and the incidence rate of adverse effects were also studied. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the efficacy rate and effect initiating time among the three groups in the acute stage. The clinical symptom score and BUA level were obviously reduced in three groups. In the intermission, BUA level in the WM-treated group and TCD plus WM-treated group were obviously reduced. Although there was a drop tendency in the BUA level in TCD-treated group, there was no statistical difference. The relapse rates in TCD-, WM- and TCD plus WM-treated groups were 12.07%, 26.79% and 9.62%, respectively. There was statistical difference in relapse rates among the three groups (P&lt;0.05). The relapse rate was decreased in TCD plus WM-treated group as compared with those in TCD-treated and WM-treated groups. The average clinical symptom scores during recurrence in the three groups were (10.00+/-3.61), (12.38+/-1.85) and (10.75+/-1.89), respectively. The incidence of adverse effects in TCD-treated group (3.45%) was lower than the other two groups (21.43% and 15.38%). CONCLUSION: The combination therapy of traditional Chinese and Western medicines based on the stage of disease can control the symptoms of gouty arthritis in the acute stage, improve joint function, and can control the BUA level during the intermission, prevent recurrence and relieve the adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 is a recently identified circulating factor which causes renal phosphate wasting disorders. Although the mechanism of regulation of FGF-23 secretion is unknown, plasma FGF-23 level may be regulated or affected by serum phosphate levels because of its hypophosphatemic effect. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that plasma FGF-23 levels may be increased in hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis. We measured plasma FGF-23 levels in 158 male uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Plasma samples were obtained before starting dialysis sessions to determine FGF-23 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Plasma FGF-23 level exhibited significant and positive correlations with inorganic phosphate, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), corrected calcium, and duration of hemodialysis on simple regression analyses. All these associations remained significant in multiple regression analyses. CONCLUSION: Serum phosphate, calcium, and intact PTH could be regulators of FGF-23 levels in uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Our results may provide new insights into the pathophysiologic effects of FGF-23 on calcium-phosphate homeostasis.",

    "title": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition down-regulates survivin and facilitates TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastomas. ",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Recent findings have correlated neuroblastoma development with aberration of apoptosis. In particular, increased levels of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, have been associated with increased resistance to apoptosis in neuroblastomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway can alter the expression of survivin and facilitate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. METHODS: Human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH, BE[2]C, LAN-1 and IMR-32) were treated with LY294002 or wortmannin, inhibitors of PI3K, for 24 hours. Transient transfection of a dominant negative PI3K expression plasmid, pCGNN-Deltap85, was performed to inhibit PI3K activation. Cells were treated with TRAIL, caspase-3, or pan-caspase inhibitors. RNase protection assay was performed to assess mRNA changes in IAP family members, including survivin. Western blot analysis was performed to measure changes in the levels of procaspases and survivin. Apoptosis was assessed by a DNA fragmentation ELISA assay. RESULTS: The authors found that survivin and cIAP1 mRNA as well as protein expression were decreased after PI3K inhibition. Combination treatment with LY294002 and TRAIL increased apoptosis of SK-N-SH cells compared with TRAIL alone; these results were further corroborated by complete inhibition of apoptosis by caspase-3 or pan-caspase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: The authors report that PI3K pathway inhibition down-regulates survivin expression and enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastomas. PI3K pathway may play a crucial role in neuroblastoma cell survival; therefore, treatment with inhibitors of PI3K may provide potential novel therapeutic options.",

It is essential in the treatment of such areas as the central nervous system (CNS) and reproductive organs. High-dose chemotherapy is applied for this purpose to obtain an effective plasma concentration in the target organs. There are three major mechanisms of nephrotoxicity related with MTX. One is that induced by allergic reaction, which usually appears as interstitial nephritis. In this case MTX is contraindicated. Another is direct pharmacological toxicity against renal tubules. The third is precipitation of MTX, which plugs the renal tubules. The latter two are consequently dose dependent, and are usually associated with high-dose chemotherapy. To prevent these nephrotoxicities, hydration and alkalinization of the urine are performed to accelerate the urinary excretion and avoid the precipitation of MTX.",

Total PKC activity in cancer tissue was significantly decreased compared to that in normal mucosa. Western blotting, using PKC isoenzyme-specific antibodies, showed that two PKC isoenzymes, PKC beta and PKC epsilon, were significantly decreased in cancer tissue. The level of PKC delta was increased in cancer tissue and the expression of PKC alpha and zeta was not altered significantly. Primary bile acids--cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)--and the principal secondary bile acids--deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)--were found to be potent and selective activators of partially purified PKC isoenzymes. PKC beta 1 was the isoenzyme most effectively activated by secondary bile acids.

    "abstract": "Gentamicin is a mainstay in treating gram-negative sepsis. However, it also may potentiate endotoxin (LPS)-driven plasma TNF-alpha increases. Because gentamicin accumulates in renal tubules, this study addressed whether gentamicin directly alters LPS-driven tubular cell TNF-alpha production. HK-2 proximal tubular cells were incubated for 18 h with gentamicin (10-2,000 microg/ml). Subsequent LPS-mediated TNF-alpha increases (at 3 or 24 h; protein/mRNA) were determined. Gentamicin effects on overall protein synthesis ([(35)S]methionine incorporation), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels, and LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha generation by isolated mouse proximal tubules also were assessed. Finally, because gentamicin undergoes partial biliary excretion, its potential influence on gut TNF-alpha/MCP-1 mRNAs was probed. Gentamicin caused striking, dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-driven TNF-alpha production (up to 80% in HK-2 cells/isolated tubules). Surprisingly, this occurred despite increased TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation. Comparable changes in MCP-1 were observed. These changes were observed at clinically relevant gentamicin concentrations and despite essentially normal overall protein synthetic rates. Streptomycin also suppressed LPS-driven TNF-alpha increases, suggesting an aminoglycoside drug class effect. Gentamicin doubled basal TNF-alpha mRNA in cecum and in small intestine after LPS. Gentamicin can suppress LPS-driven TNF-alpha production in proximal tubule cells, likely by inhibiting its translation. Overall preservation of protein synthesis and comparable MCP-1 suppression suggest a semiselective blockade within the LPS inflammatory mediator cascade. These results, coupled with increases in gut TNF-alpha/MCP-1 mRNAs, imply that gentamicin may exert protean, countervailing actions on systemic cytokine/chemokine production during gram-negative sepsis.",

Here we report recurrent mutations and deletions involving multiple components of the cohesin complex, including STAG2, RAD21, SMC1A and SMC3, in different myeloid neoplasms. These mutations and deletions were mostly mutually exclusive and occurred in 12.1% (19/157) of acute myeloid leukemia, 8.0% (18/224) of myelodysplastic syndromes, 10.2% (9/88) of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 6.3% (4/64) of chronic myelogenous leukemia and 1.3% (1/77) of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms. Cohesin-mutated leukemic cells showed reduced amounts of chromatin-bound cohesin components, suggesting a substantial loss of cohesin binding sites on chromatin. The growth of leukemic cell lines harboring a mutation in RAD21 (Kasumi-1 cells) or having severely reduced expression of RAD21 and STAG2 (MOLM-13 cells) was suppressed by forced expression of wild-type RAD21 and wild-type RAD21 and STAG2, respectively. These findings suggest a role for compromised cohesin functions in myeloid leukemogenesis. ",

    "title": "A causal role for uric acid in fructose-induced metabolic syndrome. ",
    "abstract": "The worldwide epidemic of metabolic syndrome correlates with an elevation in serum uric acid as well as a marked increase in total fructose intake (in the form of table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup). Fructose raises uric acid, and the latter inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability. Because insulin requires nitric oxide to stimulate glucose uptake, we hypothesized that fructose-induced hyperuricemia may have a pathogenic role in metabolic syndrome. Four sets of experiments were performed. First, pair-feeding studies showed that fructose, and not dextrose, induced features (hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperuricemia) of metabolic syndrome. Second, in rats receiving a high-fructose diet, the lowering of uric acid with either allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) or benzbromarone (a uricosuric agent) was able to prevent or reverse features of metabolic syndrome. In particular, the administration of allopurinol prophylactically prevented fructose-induced hyperinsulinemia (272.3 vs.160.8 pmol/l, P &lt; 0.05), systolic hypertension (142 vs. 133 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05), hypertriglyceridemia (233.7 vs. 65.4 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.01), and weight gain (455 vs. 425 g, P &lt; 0.05) at 8 wk. Neither allopurinol nor benzbromarone affected dietary intake of control diet in rats. Finally, uric acid dose dependently inhibited endothelial function as manifested by a reduced vasodilatory response of aortic artery rings to acetylcholine. These data provide the first evidence that uric acid may be a cause of metabolic syndrome, possibly due to its ability to inhibit endothelial function. Fructose may have a major role in the epidemic of metabolic syndrome and obesity due to its ability to raise uric acid.",

    "title": "Stroke and long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution from nitrogen dioxide: a cohort study. ",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Years of exposure to tobacco smoke substantially increase the risk for stroke. Whether long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution can lead to stroke is not yet established. We examined the association between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and incident and fatal stroke in a prospective cohort study. METHODS: We followed 57,053 participants of the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort in the Hospital Discharge Register for the first-ever hospital admission for stroke (incident stroke) between baseline (1993-1997) and 2006 and defined fatal strokes as death within 30 days of admission. We associated the estimated mean levels of nitrogen dioxide at residential addresses since 1971 to incident and fatal stroke by Cox regression analyses and examined the effects by stroke subtypes: ischemic, hemorrhagic, and nonspecified stroke. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 9.8 years of 52,215 eligible subjects, there were 1984 (3.8%) first-ever (incident) hospital admissions for stroke of whom 142 (7.2%) died within 30 days. We detected borderline significant associations between mean nitrogen dioxide levels at residence since 1971 and incident stroke (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99-1.11, per interquartile range increase) and stroke hospitalization followed by death within 30 days (1.22; 1.00-1.50). The associations were strongest for nonspecified and ischemic strokes, whereas no association was detected with hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution may contribute to the development of ischemic but not hemorrhagic stroke, especially severe ischemic strokes leading to death within 30 days.",

    "abstract": "The new bispyridinium oximes HI 6 and HLo 7 are promising antidotes against poisoning by highly toxic organophosphorus compounds, i.e. nerve agents. Until now, their ability to reactivate pesticide inhibited human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has not been elucidated. For this purpose human erythrocyte AChE (EC 3.1.1.7) was inhibited (30 min) by chlorfenvinphos, dichlorvos, dicrotophos, heptenophos, mevinphos, monocrotophos, paraoxon, phosphamidon, trichlorfon, malaoxon, omethoate, oxydemeton-methyl or methamidophos by 85-98% of control. After removal of excess inhibitor, obidoxime, pralidoxime (2-PAM), HI 6 or HLo 7 (10, 30 or 100 mumol/l) were added and the AChE activity was measured spectrophotometrically at various times thereafter (5-60 min). The oximes significantly, but not completely, reactivated organophosphate inhibited AChE. The velocity and extent of reactivation were dependent on the oxime and its concentration. In all cases obidoxime was superior to the three other oximes, followed by HLo 7, 2-PAM and HI 6. In most cases obidoxime and HLo 7 were most effective at 10 or 30 mumol/l while 2-PAM and HI 6 needed 100 mumol/l. These data suggest that 2-PAM HI 6 and HLo 7 are less patent than obidoxime in reactivating human AChE inhibited by organophosphate pesticides.",

    "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide is a known bladder carcinogen, with cumulative dose directly related to increased risk. There is no consensus, however, on which major cyclophosphamide metabolite (i.e., acrolein or phosphoramide mustard) drives bladder carcinogenesis. We examined 19 cyclophosphamide-related bladder tumors to test the hypothesis that they might contain somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene that could link a specific metabolite to the etiology of these cancers. Forty-three % (9 of 19) of the cases had a mutation in p53, with a predominance at G:C bp (7 of 9, 77%), a preference for non-CpG sites (6 of 7, 86%), and frequent G:C--&gt;A:T transitions (5 of 7, 71%). The p53 mutation spectrum of these cyclophosphamide-associated bladder cancers differed significantly from patterns reported for sporadic (P = 0.020), smoking-related (0.043), and schistosomiasis-linked (P = 0.002) tumors but not arylamine-associated neoplasms (P = 0.860). Differences between the cyclophosphamide and arylamine-associated spectra included an unusual degree of clustering of exon 6 mutations (43% versus 17%, respectively) and an absence of multiple mutations in the former. Notably lacking in our series were G:C--&gt;T:A transversions, the principal mutation associated with acrolein. Instead, the mutation spectrum matches the phosphoramide mustard adduction sequences determined by a repetitive primer-extension assay (P = 0.024), indicating that this metabolite might be a key mutagen in cyclophosphamide-related bladder cancer.",

Mice were administered three intraperitoneal injections of test agent (400 nmol total) on 1, 8, and 15 days after birth and evaluated for liver and lung tumors at 12 months of age. 2-Nitrobenzo[a]pyrene and 6-nitrochrysene induced a high incidence of liver tumors (91-100%), while the remaining test compounds did not induce tumors at a rate significantly higher than the solvent control. 6-Nitrochrysene was the only test agent to produce a significant increase in the frequency of lung tumors. K- and H-ras mutations were analyzed in liver tumors of treated mice and mainly occurred at the first base of K-ras codon 13, resulting in GGC --&gt; CGC transversion. Since most of the tested nitro-PAHs are mutagens in vitro, the results of this study indicate that the in vitro mutagenicity of these compounds does not correlate with their tumorigenicity in the neonatal B6C3F1 mouse bioassay. Also, the results indicate that liver tumors from mice treated with nitro-PAHs possess ras mutations typical of PAHs and their derivatives.",

Mortality rates from ISHD among residents in 60 villages of the area in Taiwan with endemic arseniasis from 1973 through 1986 were analyzed to examine their association with arsenic concentration in drinking water. Based on 1 355 915 person-years and 217 ISHD deaths, the cumulative ISHD mortalities from birth to age 79 years were 3.4%, 3.5%, 4.7%, and 6.6%, respectively, for residents who lived in villages in which the median arsenic concentrations in drinking water were &lt;0.1, 0.1 to 0.34, 0.35 to 0.59, and &gt; or = 0.6 mg/L. A cohort of 263 patients affected with blackfoot disease (BFD), a unique arsenic-related peripheral vascular disease, and 2293 non-BFD residents in the endemic area of arseniasis were recruited and followed up for an average period of 5.0 years. There was a monotonous biological gradient relationship between cumulative arsenic exposure through drinking artesian well water and ISHD mortality. The relative risks were 2.5, 4.0 and 6.5, respectively, for those who had a cumulative arsenic exposure of 0.1 to 9.9, 10.0 to 19.9, and &gt; or = 20.0 mg/L-years compared with those without the arsenic exposure after adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, body mass index, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and disease status for hypertension and diabetes through proportional-hazards regression analysis.

    "title": "The efficacies of clozapine and haloperidol in refractory schizophrenia are related to DTNBP1 variation. ",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The prototypical atypical antipsychotic agent, clozapine, is more efficacious for refractory schizophrenia than the 'typical' antipsychotics, but the mechanism underlying this enhanced efficacy is still under investigation. Since 2002, at least 22 association studies have shown that the DTNBP1 can be associated with the risk for schizophrenia. We hypothesized that DTNBP1 might also influence the response to antipsychotic treatments. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the DTNBP1 and the effects of clozapine and haloperidol on refractory schizophrenia. METHODS: Patients with refractory schizophrenia were assigned to clozapine (n=85) or haloperidol (n=96) and followed for 3 months. Symptom improvement was evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score. Six markers at DTNBP1 and 38 ancestry-informative markers were genotyped in all participants. The relationships between the effects of antipsychotics and the diplotypes, haplotypes, genotypes, and alleles of DTNBP1 were tested by analysis of covariance, analysis of variance, and t-test. RESULTS: Patients with diplotype ACCCTC/GTTGCC, genotypes T/T+T/C, or allele T of marker rs742105 (P1333) have better response to clozapine (0.005&lt; or =P&lt; or =0.049), and patients with diplotype ACCCTC/GCCGCC, genotype A/G, or allele A of marker rs909706 (P1583) have better response to haloperidol (0.007&lt; or =P&lt; or =0.080) in European-Americans, African-Americans, and/or the combined sample; European-American patients with diplotype ACCCTC/GCCGCC have worse response to clozapine on positive symptoms (P=0.011). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the DTNBP1 gene modulates the effects of both the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. Participants with different DTNBP1 diplotypes, haplotypes, genotypes, or alleles might have different responses to these antipsychotics.",

METHODS: We present the clinical findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies in a woman with hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and a palsy of cranial nerve VI, associated with cocaine-induced destruction of her nasal and paranasal structures and the anterior base of her skull. RESULTS: A 55-year-old woman, a long-term cocaine abuser, presented with delirium, nausea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and hypotension as manifestations of adrenal insufficiency (cortisol levels &lt;1 mg/dL before and after administration of cosyntropin). She was found to have a deficiency of adrenocorticotropic hormone (&lt;1 pg/mL), gonadotropin deficiency (estradiol &lt;20 pg/mL, luteinizing hormone 1.7 mIU/mL, and follicle-stimulating hormone 4.9 mIU/mL), and diabetes insipidus. She also had a palsy of right cranial nerve VI. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head demonstrated extensive destruction of the paranasal sinuses, extending into the base of the skull. Serial magnetic resonance images showed reduction of pituitary volume. Nasal biopsy specimens disclosed findings consistent with cocaine-induced ischemic necrosis. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus due to prolonged intranasal cocaine abuse.",

    "abstract": "The expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) was investigated in rats with lithium (Li)-induced polyuria, using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radioimmunoassay. The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained LiCl (60 mmol/kg) for 4 weeks developed marked polyuria. The Li-treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentrations. Plasma sodium concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the Li-treated rats compared with those in controls. Plasma concentration of AVP and transcripts of AVP gene in the PVN and SON were significantly increased in the Li-treated rats compared with controls. These results suggest that dehydration and/or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma AVP and the upregulation of AVP gene expression in the PVN and the SON of the Li-induced diabetes insipidus rat.",

    "title": "Ethanol inhibits cytokine-induced iNOS and sPLA2 in immortalized astrocytes: evidence for posttranscriptional site of ethanol action. ",
    "abstract": "Chronic and excessive ethanol consumption is known to alter neuron and glial cell functions in the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes comprise the major cell type in the brain. These immune active cells are capable of responding to proinflammatory cytokines and endotoxins, which stimulate transcriptional pathways leading to induction of genes, including the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). In this study, we investigate the effects of ethanol on cytokine-induced iNOS and sPLA2 in immortalized astrocytes (DITNC). When DITNC cells were exposed to ethanol (0-200 mM) for 4 h prior to subsequent stimulation with cytokines for 16 h, NO production decreased with increasing ethanol concentrations starting from 50 mM. At ethanol concentrations higher than 100 mM, ethanol also inhibited cytokine-induced sPLA2 release into the culture medium. The inhibitory effect of ethanol on NO production corresponds well with the decrease in iNOS protein and NOS enzyme activity, but not with iNOS and sPLA2 mRNA nor binding of NF-kappaB to DNA. The inhibition of cytokine-induced NO production by ethanol was also dependent on the time of ethanol exposure to the cells, but addition of acetaldehyde up to 200 microM did not elicit any changes. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a posttranscriptional mode of ethanol action on the cytokine induction pathway for NO production in astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Induction of expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been studied in primary cultures of chick embryo liver cells and in the LMH line of avian hepatoma cells. Cells were transiently transfected with selected constructs containing portions of the 5'-untranslated (promoter) region of the HO-1 gene linked to luciferase as reporter gene. LMH cells that had been stably transfected with selected wild type or mutant constructs were also studied. Metalloporphyrins, especially Fe protoporphyrin (heme) and Co protoporphyrin strongly induced luciferase expression in both types of transfected cells. Low concentrations of Zn mesoporphyrin, an inhibitor of HO activity, exerted a synergistic effect on heme-, but not Co protoporphyrin-dependent induction. The antioxidant and &amp;bond;SH donor N-acetyl cysteine had little effect on the metalloporphyrin-dependent inductions of HO-1, in contrast to its marked inhibitory effect on the sodium arsenite-dependent induction of the HO-1 gene. Deletional analysis showed that the key element(s) required for the metalloporphyrin-dependent induction of HO-1 is located between -3.6 and -5.6 kb upstream of the transcription starting point. Data from electrophoretic mobility shift and site-directed mutagenesis experiments excluded a role for consensus AP-1 binding elements at -1576, -3647, or -4578 in the inductions produced by heme or Co protoporphyrin.",

    "abstract": "18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (18beta-GA) is a bioactive component of licorice with promising hepatoprotective activity. However, its protective mechanism on methotrexate (MTX) hepatotoxicity in not well defined. We investigated the hepatoprotective effect of 18beta-GA, pointing to the role of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and the redox-sensitive nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Wistar rats were orally administered 18beta-GA (50 and 100 mg/kg) 7 days either before or after MTX injection. MTX induced significant increase in circulating liver function marker enzymes and bilirubin with concomitant declined albumin levels. Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, and liver malondialdehyde and nitric oxide were significantly increased in MTX-induced rats. Treatment with 18beta-GA significantly reduced serum enzymes of liver function, bilirubin and pro-inflammatory cytokines. 18beta-GA attenuated MTX-induced oxidative stress and restored the antioxidant defenses. In addition, 18beta-GA improved liver histological structure and decreased the expression of Bax whereas increased Bcl-2 expression. MTX-induced rats showed significant down-regulation of Nrf2, hemoxygenase-1 and PPARgamma, an effect that was markedly reversed by 18beta-GA supplemented either before or after MTX. In conclusion, 18beta-GA protected against MTX-induced liver injury, possibly by activating Nrf2 and PPARgamma, and subsequent attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Therefore, 18beta-GA can provide protection against MTX-induced hepatotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the Na-K ATPase, has been shown to exert immunosuppressive effects. The goals of this study were to define the stage of the proliferative response which is sensitive to ouabain and to correlate the inhibitory action of ouabain on cell proliferation with its effect on Na-K ATPase activity. We found that ouabain inhibited T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and this inhibition was similar in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. To define the role of the Na-K ATPase in early activation of T lymphocytes, we examined the effects of ouabain on the induction of competence (acquisition of responsiveness to interleukin (IL)-2 or IL-4) by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or the combination of phorbol dibutyrate/ionomycin. Ouabain, at concentrations that completely inhibited the enzyme activity, did not interfere with the induction of competence, suggesting that although activated cells express increased activity of Na-K ATPase, this enzyme activity does not play a role in early activation pathways. In contrast, ouabain inhibited the progression phase to DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner even at concentrations that had little or no effect on Na-K ATPase activity. This inhibition was not due to a decrease in the production of IL-2 but rather to an inhibition of the expression of the p55 and p75 subunits of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). The inhibition of p55 appeared to occur at the mRNA level. These results indicate that the activity of the Na-K ATPase is not essential for the induction of competence or early activation. On the other hand, inhibition of cell proliferation and transcription of IL-2R subunits by low concentrations of ouabain may be related to changes in intracellular K+ concentrations or to inhibition of membranal phospholipid metabolism secondary to alteration in Na-K ATPase activity.",

It has been shown that 15-20% of patients with familial ALS (FALS) have defects in the Sod1 gene that encodes Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). To elucidate the pathological role of mutated Cu, Zn-SODs in FALS, the susceptibility of mutants to glycation was examined. Mutated Cu, Zn-SODs (G37R, G93A, and I113T) related to FALS and wild type were produced in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Glycated and nonglycated proteins were separated on a boronate column, and the nonglycated fraction was then incubated with glucose. The mutated Cu, Zn-SODs were found to be highly susceptible to glycation compared with the wild-type enzyme as estimated by Western blot analysis using an anti-hexitol lysine antibody. The mutated Cu, Zn-SOD incubated with glucose generated higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than the wild-type enzyme. Mutated Cu, Zn-SODs were also shown to be highly susceptible to fructation, and the fructated mutant also produced higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than the wild type. These results suggest that high susceptibility of mutated Cu, Zn-SODs to glycation could be the origin of the oxidative stress associated with neuronal dysfunction in FALS.",

    "abstract": "The nonsteroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used anticancer drug. In women with breast cancer, adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen reduces relapse and improves overall survival. In advanced breast cancer, the response rate is more than 50% in hormonal dependent disease. In women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen the incidence of new primary breast cancers is decreased. This latter observation has led to the initiation of prevention trials. In 1989 the first report from a large prospective randomised trial showed a significant increase of endometrial carcinoma among women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. This effect may be linked to the somewhat paradoxical estrogenic properties of tamoxifen. The endometrial effects should be considered in the long term use of tamoxifen, and should also be taken into account in the evaluation of the prevention trials. Animal data indicate that tamoxifen can induce tumours in other organ systems, for example the liver, but no increase in primary liver cancer has been reported from the randomised trials. In some of these trials an increase in other gastrointestinal cancers (e.g. colon and gastric carcinoma) has been observed. The mechanism behind this may be different from that of the endometrium. In animal systems, tamoxifen has shown to induce DNA damage, with formation of DNA adducts. The risk of secondary gastrointestinal cancer needs to be further evaluated. The adverse effects of tamoxifen have led to the development of new anti-estrogenic drugs and other estrogen reducing agents (e.g. aromatase inhibitors).",

In both groups, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was reduced to 60 mmHg by intravenous administration of ATP. During hypotensive anesthesia, coronary blood flow, myocardial blood flow and cardiac index increased significantly in both groups. Lactic acid and uric acid increased significantly during hypotensive anesthesia in the group 1. Heart rate, MAP, systemic vascular resistance and coronary vascular resistance decreased significantly during hypotensive anesthesia in both groups. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and central venous pressure showed no significant changes in both groups. Base excess in the group 1 increased markedly compared with the group 2. We conclude that pretreatment with dipyridamole can prevent metabolic acidosis that occurs during hypotensive anesthesia induced by ATP.",

    "abstract": "Casticin, a polymethoxyflavone, derived from natural plant Fructus Viticis exhibits biological activities including anti-cancer characteristics. The anti-cancer and alter gene expression of casticin on human colon cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Flow cytometric assay was used to measure viable cell, cell cycle and sub-G1 phase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ productions, level of mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim ) and caspase activity. Western blotting assay was used to detect expression of protein level associated with cell death. Casticin induced cell morphological changes, decreased cell viability and induced G2/M phase arrest in colo 205 cells. Casticin increased ROS production but decreased the levels of DeltaPsim , and Ca2+ , increased caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities. The cDNA microarray indicated that some of the cell cycle associated genes were down-regulated such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) (p21, Cip1) and p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 3 (PAK3). TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), CREB1 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 1) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) (p27, Kip1) genes were increased but matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), PRKAR2B (protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, regulatory, type II, bet), and CaMK4 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV) genes were inhibited. Results suggest that casticin induced cell apoptosis via the activation of the caspase- and/or mitochondria-dependent signaling cascade, the accumulation of ROS and altered associated gene expressions in colo 205 human colon cancer cells.",

Electrophysiological studies suggest that chorea is associated with abnormal synchronization of firing of basal ganglia neurons while dystonia is not. Levetiracetam is a novel anti-epileptic drug known to exhibit unique desynchronizing properties in contrast to other anti-epileptic drugs. We assessed the anti-dyskinetic efficacy of levetiracetam (13, 30 and 60 mg/kg, p.o.) administered in combination with an individually tailored dose of levodopa (Levodopa/carbidopa, 4:1 ratio, 19+/-1.8 mg/kg, p.o.), in six dyskinetic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned macaques. Levetiracetam (60 mg/kg) significantly reduced levodopa-induced chorea during the first hour post-treatment but had no effect on dystonia. Levetiracetam, at all doses tested, had no effect on the anti-parkinsonian action of levodopa. These results suggest that levetiracetam may provide a novel therapeutic approach specifically aimed at the choreic form of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Symptomatic visual field constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported. The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin-attributed visual field loss, three of whom were reported previously. Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin. METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken. RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field. The eighth exhibited concentric constriction. Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave. However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials. Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level. CONCLUSION: Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy. The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn.",

Kidney and mesentery of rats were perfused. In the short-term treated groups, there was no significant change in systolic blood pressure. The response to noradrenaline only in renal vascular beds was significantly increased by FK506 and this increase was prevented by Bosentan. FK506 had no significant effect on sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilation in comparison with solvent in both vascular beds. Bosentan failed to prevent these responses. In the long-term treated groups, at the end of the treatment with FK506, there was a significant increase in blood pressure, but no change in the response to noradrenaline in either kidneys or mesentery. The increase in blood pressure was prevented by bosentan treatment. FK506 increased malondialdehyde levels in the kidneys of the rats from only the long-term treated groups. Bosentan did not change this increase. Our results indicated that endothelin-1 plays a key role in the FK506-induced change in vascular reactivity to noradrenaline in renal vascular beds and drug-induced hypertension in the rats. There was no relationship between oxidative stress and FK506-induced hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists alleviate memory deficits caused by aging or by administration of beta-amyloid peptides in rodents, which is in accordance with the beneficial effects of caffeine consumption (an adenosine receptor antagonist) on memory performance in aged individuals and in preventing Alzheimer's disease. We now tested if A2A receptor blockade affords a general beneficial effect in different experimental paradigms disturbing memory performance in rodents. The beta-amyloid fragment present in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Abeta1-42, 2 nmol, icv) decreased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze after 15 days (29%) to an extent similar to the decrease of memory performance caused by scopolamine (2 mg/kg, ip) or MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg, ip) after 30 min (28% and 39%, respectively). The selective A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261 (0.05 mg/kg, ip every 24 h, starting 30 min before the noxious stimuli) prevented Abeta1-42-induced amnesia, but failed to modify scopolamine- or MK-801-induced amnesia. Similar conclusions were reached when testing another A2A receptor antagonist (KW6002, 3 mg/kg, ip). These results indicate that A2A receptors do not affect general processes of memory impairment but instead play a crucial role restricted to neurodegenerative conditions involving an insidious synaptic deterioration leading to memory dysfunction.",

Morphological changes were found in 57% of the male rats with lithium-induced uraemia after lithium administration for 16 weeks postnatally. The changes comprised myocytic degeneration and necrosis associated with infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes and plasma cells. This morphological picture is different from the myocardial changes associated with chronic renal failure. Male rats with chronic uraemia after withdrawal of lithium 8 weeks postnatally showed no myocardial changes after 16 weeks. Also, male rats with normal renal function had no myocardial changes after 16 weeks on lithium, but these rats had a significantly lower plasma level of lithium than the lithium-uraemic rats (0.8 vs. 1.4 mmol/l). It is suggested that myocarditis was a consequence of persistent high plasma levels of lithium maintained in the lithium-uraemic rats and that cardiotoxic effects of lithium may be potentiated by concomitant renal failure.",

    "abstract": "Ketanserin is a new strong antiserotoninergic drug that, unlike the previous ones, is selective for 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors. This drug has been employed successfully in the treatment of arterial hypertension and of some peripheral vascular diseases. The authors are carrying out a trial on medium term treatment with ketanserin (K) or propranolol (P) in comparison with placebo, to evaluate their effects on blood pressure, haemocoagulative parameters and peripheral circulation. The trial is a double-blind cross-over random trial on subjects with mild or moderate hypertension. Until now 13 patients have ended the study; six of them are suffering from arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs at 1st or 2nd stage according to Fontaine. Both propranolol and ketanserin significantly reduced the blood pressure, although the decrease in systolic blood pressure was more evident after propranolol. Heart rate diminished significantly only after propranolol administration. The noninvasive, intermittent (every 30 min) monitoring of blood pressure showed a significant 24-hour reduction of blood pressure after administration of propranolol or ketanserin without significant changes of circadian behaviour of the blood pressure. After administration of ketanserin a slight improvement in peripheral circulation was demonstrated, evaluated by using strain-gauge plethysmography. As regards the results obtained for platelet function and other haemocoagulative parameters examined, adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation, adenosine diphosphate slope, collagen lag period, antithrombin III biological activity, and serum fibrinogen did not show noticeable modifications after treatment, while beta-thromboglobulin levels decreased slightly after ketanserin administration.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) is a highly aggressive disease. Despite the use of various treatment regimens, the prognosis of NKTL is poor, and new treatment strategies need to be determined. Because of the significant survival potential, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB has become one of the major targets for drug development. In this study, we explored the effect and action mechanism of NF-kappaB inhibitors, BAY 11-7082 and curcumin, on NKTL cell lines (NKL, NK-92 and HANK1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that NF-kappaB was constitutively active in HANK1, a chemoresistant cell line. BAY 11-7082 and curcumin suppressed NF-kappaB activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which finally resulted in cell death. BAY 11-7082- and curcumin-induced cell death was associated with downregulation of Bcl-xL, cyclin D1, XIAP and c-FLIP, followed by caspase-8, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and activation. Given that the chemoresistant NK-92 cells respond to NF-kappaB inhibitors but not to conventional drugs, BAY 11-7082 and curcumin could be potentially useful for achieving improved outcome in chemotherapy-refractory NKTL.",

    "abstract": "The role of different isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the gastric mucosal hyperemia, induced by 155 mM luminal hydrochloric acid (pH approximately 0.8) without a barrier breaker, was investigated. Rats were anesthetized with Inactin (120 mg/kg ip), and mice were anesthetized with Forene (2.2% in 40% oxygen gas at 150 ml/min); the gastric mucosa was exteriorized. Gastric mucosal blood flow was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) in rats treated with Nomega-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA; unspecific NOS inhibitor), l-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine [l-NIL; inducible (i) NOS inhibitor], or S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline [SMTC; neuronal (n) NOS inhibitor], 10 mg/kg, followed by 3 mg. kg-1. h-1 iv, in iNOS-deficient (-/-) and nNOS(-/-) mice. mRNA was isolated from the gastric mucosa in iNOS(-/-) and wild-type (wt) mice, and real-time RT-PCR was performed. The effect of 155 mM acid on gastric mucosal permeability was determined by measuring the clearance of 51Cr-EDTA from blood to lumen. LDF increased by 48 +/- 13% during 155 mM HCl luminally, an increase that was abolished by l-NNA, SMTC, or l-NIL. In iNOS wt mice, LDF increased by 33 +/- 8% during luminal acid. The blood flow increase was attenuated substantially in iNOS(-/-) mice. RT-PCR revealed iNOS mRNA expression in the gastric mucosa in the iNOS wt groups. The blood flow increase in response to acid was not abolished in nNOS(-/-) mice (nNOS-sufficient mice, 39 +/- 18%; heterozygous mice, 25 +/- 19%; -/- mice, 19 +/- 7%). Mucosal permeability was transiently increased during 155 mM HCl. The results suggest that iNOS is constitutively expressed in the gastric mucosa and is involved in acid-induced hyperemia, suggesting a novel role for iNOS in gastric mucosal protection.",

A total of 16 patients (8 men, 8 women; age 35-83 years) meeting the inclusion criteria of severe sepsis were enrolled in this study. The follow-up was performed on days 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 of hospitalization at the intensive care unit (ICU). Blood coagulation (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], prothrombin time [PT], fibrinogen, antithrombin (AT), protein C [PC], D-dimer, fragment 1.2 [F1.2], factor Xa [FXa] inhibition) and inflammatory reactants (interleukin 6 [IL-6], C-reactive protein [CRP], orosomucoid, alpha-1-antitrypsin) were tested. The mean FXa inhibition was 0.17 (+ or - 0.17) IU/mL. The arbitrarily established range of FXa inhibition for prophylaxis, 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL, was reached in 22 cases (20%), while in 74 cases (68%), it was below and in 13 cases (12%) above the aforementioned range. Factor Xa inhibition positively correlated with AT (r = .42; P &lt; .001) and PC (r = .45; P &lt; .001) activities. A negative correlation was found between the FXa inhibition and alpha-1-antitrypsin concentrations (r = -.33; P = .01) but only in the subgroup with alpha-1-antitrypsin concentrations &gt; or = 2.2 g/L. We confirmed that in most patients with sepsis, the prophylaxis with enoxaparin did not lead to the required FXa inhibition. The inhibition of FXa by enoxaparin depends mainly on the AT and PC activities.",

    "abstract": "Primaquine-induced hemolytic anemia is a toxic side effect that is due to premature splenic sequestration of intact erythrocytes. Previous studies have suggested that a phenolic metabolite, 5-hydroxyprimaquine (5-HPQ), mediates primaquine hemotoxicity by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) within erythrocytes that overwhelm antioxidant defenses. However, the nature of the oxidative stress is not understood, and the molecular targets, whether protein and/or lipid, are unknown. To investigate the mechanism underlying the hemolytic activity of 5-HPQ, we have examined the effect of hemolytic concentrations of 5-HPQ on ROS formation within rat erythrocytes using the cellular ROS probe, 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluoresein diacetate. In addition, we examined the effect of 5-HPQ on membrane lipids and cytoskeletal proteins. The data indicate that 5-HPQ causes a prolonged, concentration-dependent generation of ROS within erythrocytes. Interestingly, 5-HPQ-generated ROS was not associated with the onset of lipid peroxidation or an alteration in phosphatidylserine asymmetry. Instead, 5-HPQ induced oxidative injury to the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, as evidenced by changes in the normal electrophoretic pattern of membrane ghost proteins. Immunoblotting with an anti-hemoglobin antibody revealed that these changes were due primarily to the formation of disulfide-linked hemoglobin-skeletal protein adducts. The data suggest that cytoskeletal protein damage, rather than membrane lipid peroxidation or loss of phosphatidylserine asymmetry, underlies the process of removal of erythrocytes exposed to 5-HPQ.",

    "title": "Pharmacogenetic study of the impact of ABCB1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms on lenalidomide treatment outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma: results from a phase IV observational study and subsequent phase II clinical trial. ",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite therapeutic advances, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) continue to experience disease relapse and treatment resistance. The gene ABCB1 encodes the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, which confers resistance through drug extrusion across the cell membrane. Lenalidomide (Len) is excreted mainly via the kidneys, and, given the expression of P-gp in the renal tubuli, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ABCB1 gene may influence Len plasma concentrations and, subsequently, the outcome of treatment. We, therefore, investigated the influence of ABCB1 genetic variants on Len treatment outcomes and adverse events (AEs). METHODS: Ninety patients with relapsed or refractory MM, who received the second-line Len plus dexamethasone in the Rev II trial, were genotyped for the ABCB1 SNPs 1199G&gt;A (Ser400Asn, rs2229109), 1236C&gt;T (silent, rs1128503), 2677G&gt;T/A (Ala893Ser, rs2032582), and 3435C&gt;T (silent, rs1045642) using pyrosequencing, and correlations to response parameters, outcomes, and AEs were investigated. RESULTS: No significant associations were found between genotype and either best response rates or hematological AEs, and 1236C&gt;T, 2677G&gt;T or 3435C&gt;T genotypes had no impact on survival. There was a trend towards increased time to progression (TTP) in patients carrying the 1199A variant, and a significant difference in TTP between genotypes in patients with standard-risk cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a limited influence of ABCB1 genotype on lenalidomide treatment efficacy and safety. The results suggest that 1199G&gt;A may be a marker of TTP following Len treatment in standard-risk patients; however, larger studies are needed to validate and clarify the relationship.",

    "abstract": "A fluorescence polarization (FP) assay based on estrogen receptor was developed for the determination of bisphenol compounds (BPs). The human estrogen receptor alpha ligand binding domain (hERalpha-LBD) and coumestrol were employed as recognition element and fluorescent probe, respectively. Competitive displacement of tracer from receptor suggested that BPs exhibited dose-dependent binding to hERalpha-LBD. In order to elucidate the structural basis for the interaction between BPs and hERalpha-LBD, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore their complexation mechanism. The docked bisphenol compounds adopted agonist/antagonist conformations with varying positions and orientations in the hydrophobic binding pocket, depending on their structural characteristics of bridging moieties. Interestingly, the calculated binding energies were generally correlated with the experimentally measured affinities, indicating a potential advantage of the molecular modeling approach in predicting the binding potencies of putative ligands. Considering that the real samples may contain more than one BP, the established FP assay can potentially be used as a pre-screening method to determine the total amounts of bisphenol compounds.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: PD-0332991 is a selective inhibitor of the CDK4/6 kinases with the ability to block retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation in the low nanomolar range. Here we investigate the role of CDK4/6 inhibition in human ovarian cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the effects of PD-0332991 on proliferation, cell-cycle, apoptosis, and Rb phosphorylation using a panel of 40 established human ovarian cancer cell lines. Molecular markers for response prediction, including p16 and Rb, were studied using gene expression profiling, Western blot, and array CGH. Multiple drug effect analysis was used to study interactions with chemotherapeutic drugs. Expression of p16 and Rb was studied using immunohistochemistry in a large clinical cohort of ovarian cancer patients. RESULTS: Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of PD-0332991 were seen in all ovarian cancer cell lines, but varied significantly between individual lines. Rb-proficient cell lines with low p16 expression were most responsive to CDK4/6 inhibition. Copy number variations of CDKN2A, RB, CCNE1, and CCND1 were associated with response to PD-0332991. CDK4/6 inhibition induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, blocked Rb phosphorylation in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, and enhanced the effects of chemotherapy. Rb-proficiency with low p16 expression was seen in 97/262 (37%) of ovarian cancer patients and was independently associated with poor progression-free survival (adjusted relative risk 1.49, 95% CI 1.00-2.24, P = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: PD-0332991 shows promising biologic activity in ovarian cancer cell lines. Assessment of Rb and p16 expression may help select patients most likely to benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition in ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Chronic consumption of ethanol can cause cumulative liver damage that can ultimately lead to cirrhosis. To explore the mechanisms of alcoholic steatosis, we investigated the global intrahepatic gene expression profiles of livers from mice administered alcohol. Ethanol was administered by feeding the standard Lieber-DeCarli diet, of which 36% (high dose) and 3.6% (low dose) of the total calories were supplied from ethanol for 1, 2, or 4 weeks. Histopathological evaluation of the liver samples revealed fatty changes and punctate necrosis in the high-dose group and ballooning degeneration in the low-dose group. In total, 292 genes were identified as ethanol responsive, and several of these differed significantly in expression compared to those of control mice (two-way ANOVA; p&lt;0.05). Specifically, the expression levels of genes involved in hepatic lipid transport and metabolism were examined. An overall net increase in gene expression was observed for genes involved in (i) glucose transport and glycolysis, (ii) fatty acid influx and de novo synthesis, (iii) fatty acid esterification to triglycerides, and (iv) cholesterol transport, de novo cholesterol synthesis, and bile acid synthesis. Collectively, these data provide useful information concerning the global gene expression changes that occur due to alcohol intake and provide important insights into the comprehensive mechanisms of chronic alcoholic steatosis.",

The LiFePO4 nanocrystals synthesized at low temperature exhibited mono-dispersed and carbon-mixed plate-type LiFePO4 nanoparticles with average length, width, and thickness of approximately 100 to 300 nm, 100 to 200 nm, and 50 nm, respectively.

    "title": "EGF-receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling are activated by benzo[a]pyrene 3,6-quinone and benzo[a]pyrene 1,6-quinone in human mammary epithelial cells. ",
    "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is activated by xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes to highly mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolites. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that benzo[a]pyrene quinones (BPQs), 1,6-BPQ and 3,6-BPQ, are able to induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cell signaling through the production of reactive oxygen species. Recently, we have reported that BPQs have the potential to induce the expression of genes involved in numerous pathways associated with cell proliferation and survival in human mammary epithelial cells. In the present study we demonstrated that BPQs not only induced EGFR tyrosine autophosphorylation, but also induced EGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1 and several signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The effects of BPQs were evaluated in a model of EGF withdrawal in MCF10-A cells. We found that BPQs (1 muM), induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation at positions Y845, Y992, Y1068, and Y1086. PLC-gamma1 phosphorylation correlated with the phosphorylation of tyrosine-Y992, a proposed docking site for PLC-gamma1 on the EGFR. Additionally, we found that BPQs induced the activation of STAT-1, STAT-3, STAT-5a and STAT-5b. STAT5 was shown to translocate to the nucleus following 3,6-BPQ and 1,6-BPQ exposures. Although the patterns of phosphorylation at EGFR, PLC-gamma1 and STATs were quite similar to those induced by EGF, an important difference between BPQ-mediated signaling of the EGFR was observed. Signaling produced by EGF ligand produced a rapid disappearance of EGFR from the cell surface, whereas BPQ signaling maintained EGFR receptors on the cell membrane. Thus, the results of these studies show that 1,6-BPQ and 3,6-BPQ can produce early events as evidenced by EGFR expression, and a prolonged transactivation of EGFR leading to downstream cell signaling pathways.",

In some cases, MTX-induced renal failure occurs which may not be prevented by the standard agent folin acid as a specific antidot. This results in a MTX-accumulation in the body tissue with subsequent massive toxic side effects. CASE REPORT: We report on a 62-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (first diagnosis November 1997) receiving chemotherapy with 2,340 mg methotrexate over 24 hours. After an increase of the MTX-plasma-level 36 hours following MTX-application, increased serum creatinine levels (maximum 5.07 mg/dl) were found. The application of folinic acid was without any significant effect. Fifty-six hours following MTX, 50 U/kg carboxypeptidase-G2 was infused. The MTX-plasma-level decreased rapidly and a recovery of renal function was monitored. CONCLUSION: CPDG2 may be highly effective in patients after development of an MTX-induced renal failure and delayed MTX-excretion.",

Although hyperuricemia is the most common side effect of MZ, there are no case reports of acute allograft renal failure associated with MZ. This report describes a patient who developed acute allograft renal failure and hyperuricemia during MZ treatment. Accordingly, MZ treatment was terminated, hemodialysis was initiated, and allopurinol was administered. Hemodialysis was necessary only once. The patient's condition improved with these treatments, and renal function recovered. Care should be taken during treatment with MZ to avoid latent renal dysfunction. Monitoring of serum uric acid levels was necessary. Moreover, it may be necessary to consider discontinuation of MZ and initiation of hemodialysis in cases of transient renal dysfunction. No prisoners were used and no organs from prisoners were used in the study.",

    "abstract": "1. Castor oil (2 ml orally) produced diarrhoea in rats 1-7 h after challenge, which was associated with gross damage to the duodenal and jejunal mucosa. 2. The injury was accompanied by release of acid phosphatase into the gut lumen, indicating cellular injury. 3. Intraperitoneal injection of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 2.5-50 mg kg-1 twice), prevented the diarrhoea. The dose of L-NAME (50 mg kg-1) completely blocked the diarrhoea but increased the release of acid phosphatase and worsened the gross damage. 4. The NO donating compound, isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IMN, 150 mg kg-1 twice) reversed the effects of L-NAME (50 mg kg-1) on castor oil-induced diarrhoea, gross damage and acid phosphatase release. 5. The apparent dissociation of the diarrhoeal and intestinal mucosal damaging effects of castor oil suggest that NO has a protective effect on the rat duodenal and jejunal mucosa, but that NO mediates, in part, the diarrhoea effect of this laxative.",

The resulting treated cells were then examined using human gene microarrays supplied by Agilent. These chips typically have somewhere on the order of 30,000 individual genes which are expressed in the human genome. For our study, this large list of genes was reduced to 205 principal genes thought to be important for skin and each individual ingredient was examined for its influence on the culled list of genes. Working on a hypothesis that there may be some common genes which are either upregulated or downregulated by all or most of these ingredients, a short list of genes for each cell line was developed. What appears to emerge from these studies is that several genes in the gene pool that was screened are influenced by most or all of the molecules of interest. Genes that appear to be upregulated in both cell lines by all the ingredients include: ACLY, AQP3, COX1, NOS3, and PLOD3. Genes that appear to be downregulated in both cell lines by all ingredients include only PGR.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Thalidomide and its more potent immunomodulatory derivative lenalidomide enhance rituximab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We therefore evaluated lenalidomide and rituximab in symptomatic Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) patients naive to either agent. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Intended therapy consisted of 48 weeks of lenalidomide (25 mg/d for 3 weeks and then 1 week off) along with rituximab (375 mg/m(2)/wk) dosed on weeks 2 to 5 and 13 to 16. Sixteen patients were enrolled, 12 of whom were previously untreated. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, we observed an acute decrease in hematocrit in 13 of 16 patients (median hematocrit decrease, 4.8%), which was attributable to lenalidomide patients and which led to cessation of further enrollment on this study. Lenalidomide-related anemia was observed even at doses as low as 5 mg/d and occurred in the absence of hemolysis or other cytopenias. The overall response and major response (&lt;50% decrease in serum IgM) rates were 50% and 25%, respectively, on an intent-to-treat basis. With a median follow-up of 31.3 months, 4 of 8 responding patients have progressed with a median time to progression of 18.9 months. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide produces unexpected but clinically significant acute anemia in patients with WM. In comparison with our previous study with thalidomide and rituximab in an analogous patient population, the responses achieved in WM patients with lenalidomide and rituximab appear less favorable.",

    "abstract": "Giant cell tumor of bone is an aggressive tumor characterized by extensive bone destruction and high recurrence rates. This tumor consists of stromal cells and hematopoietic cells that interact in an autocrine manner to produce tumoral osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. This autocrine regulation may be disrupted by novel therapeutic agents. Nonspecific local adjuvant therapies such as phenol or liquid nitrogen have been used in the treatment of giant cell tumor, but specific adjuvant therapies have not been described. The bisphosphonates pamidronate and Zoledronate can induce apoptosis in giant cell tumor culture in a dose-dependent manner. We established giant cell tumor cultures from patients with extensive destruction of bone. One of the four cultures formed osteoclastlike giant cells in vitro after more than six passages without exogenous receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand or macrophage colony stimulating factor. Annexin V staining, presence of active cleaved form of caspase-3, and disappearance of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase on Western blotting indicated activation of apoptosis by bisphosphonates in giant cell tumor. These results indicate that topical or systemic use of pamidronate or zoledronate can be a novel adjuvant therapy for giant cell tumor by targeting osteoclastlike giant cells, mononuclear giant cell precursor cells, and the autocrine loop of tumor osteoclastogenesis.",

Animal models suggest that when activated microglia are further activated by a subsequent systemic infection this results in significantly raised levels of interleukin 1beta within the CNS, which may in turn potentiate neurodegeneration. This prospective pilot study in Alzheimer's disease subjects showed that cognitive function can be impaired for at least two months after the resolution of a systemic infection and that cognitive impairment is preceded by raised serum levels of interleukin 1beta. These relations were not confounded by the presence of any subsequent systemic infection or by baseline cognitive scores. Further research is needed to determine whether recurrent systemic infections drive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease subjects through a cytokine mediated pathway.",

Nine GSTs have been identified by MALDI-TOF MS. In the absence of special treatments, eight GSTs could be positively identified. These were DmGSTs D1 (the dominant Delta isoform which was present in five protein zones of differing pI) and D3 (and possibly also D5); the Epsilon-class GSTs E3, 6, 7 and 9 and a previously uncharacterised, probable member of the class, CG16936. The Sigma-class DmGSTS1 was prominent. DmGSTD2 was detected only after pretreatment of the flies with Phenobarbital (PhB). Treatment with Paraquat (PQ) led to an increase in the total GST activity, as measured with the substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 3,4-dichloro-nitrobenzene (DCNB) and an increase in the relative amounts of the D1, D3, E6 and E7 isoforms. PhB treatment led to increases in the relative amounts of the D1, D2, E3, E6, E7 and E9 isoforms detected with a possible depression in the relative amount of GSTS1.

    "abstract": "Oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OPAHs) are byproducts of combustion and photo-oxidation of parent PAHs. OPAHs are widely present in the environment and pose an unknown hazard to human health. The developing zebrafish was used to evaluate a structurally diverse set of 38 OPAHs for malformation induction, gene expression changes and mitochondrial function. Zebrafish embryos were exposed from 6 to 120h post fertilization (hpf) to a dilution series of 38 different OPAHs and evaluated for 22 developmental endpoints. AHR activation was determined via CYP1A immunohistochemistry. Phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PHEQ), 1,9-benz-10-anthrone (BEZO), xanthone (XAN), benz(a)anthracene-7,12-dione (7,12-B[a]AQ), and 9,10-anthraquinone (9,10-ANTQ) were evaluated for transcriptional responses at 48hpf, prior to the onset of malformations. qRT-PCR was conducted for a number of oxidative stress genes, including the glutathione transferase(gst), glutathione peroxidase(gpx), and superoxide dismutase(sod) families. Bioenergetics was assayed to measure in vivo oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in 26hpf embryos exposed to OPAHs. Hierarchical clustering of the structure-activity outcomes indicated that the most toxic of the OPAHs contained adjacent diones on 6-carbon moieties or terminal, para-diones on multi-ring structures. 5-carbon moieties with adjacent diones were among the least toxic OPAHs while the toxicity of multi-ring structures with more centralized para-diones varied considerably. 9,10-PHEQ, BEZO, 7,12-B[a]AQ, and XAN exposures increased expression of several oxidative stress related genes and decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), a measurement of mitochondrial respiration. Comprehensive in vivo characterization of 38 structurally diverse OPAHs indicated differential AHR dependency and a prominent role for oxidative stress in the toxicity mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effects of air pollution in urethane-induced lung tumours in mice by means of histological, morphometrical, and DNA ploidy. The experimental exposure was done in locations with different air pollution profiles: a polluted area (downtown Sao Paulo) and a \"clean\" environment. Swiss mice were employed and urethane (3 g/kg) was used as a carcinogenic substance. All the animals, whether exposed or not to air pollution, were sacrificed after 6 months, and the lung lesions were analysed. The results showed a significant effect of air pollution on tumour progression, observed by changes in the phenotype of the tumour cells as demonstrated by morphometry and DNA ploidy. We observed more atypical adenomas in the air pollution-exposed group (p = 0.02). Coherently, morphometric differences were also detected between the two groups. Neoplasms of exposed mice exhibited an increase in the nuclear fraction (p = 0.002) and in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio (p = 0.011), as a decrease in the stromal fraction (p &lt; 0.001). There was a higher risk of aneuploidy in the 6-months-of-air-pollution-exposure group (relative risk: 1.58; 95% of confidence interval: 1.007 to 2.403). These results indicate that urban air pollution accelerates the process of progression towards malignancy.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Doxorubicin (Dox) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent associated with severe cardiotoxicity. Erythropoietin (Epo) has recently been shown to exhibit proangiogenic properties related to endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization. We tested the hypothesis that EPC are compromised in rats with Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and correction of this functional impairment by treatment with Epo could result in attenuation of myocardial dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wistar rats were either treated with two different doses of Epo (20U or 200U) or PBS (n = 40 in each group) for four consecutive weeks, followed by Dox administration. In a second study, EPC obtained from healthy rats were transfused intravenously (n = 20/group) prior to induction of Dox cardiomyopathy. EPC from healthy subjects were evaluated for their proliferative and migratory properties in the presence or absence of Dox and Epo pre-treatment. Echocardiography demonstrated an improvement in fractional shortening (FS) in Epo-treated rats. Epo treatment was associated with a reduced mortality in both Epo-treated groups. Circulating EPC numbers were three times higher in Epo-treated compared with non-treated animals. Adhesive properties, migration, and tube formation capacity in matrigel of EPCs from both Epo-treated groups as compared with controls were significantly enhanced. EPC transfer to Dox-treated rats led to functional myocardial improvement equivalent to the protection afforded by treatment with Epo. In EPC obtained from humans, pre-incubation with Epo significantly attenuated the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects of treatment with Dox. CONCLUSION: Epo treatment is potentially protective against myocardial dysfunction induced by Dox. These effects are partially mediated by enhancement in the number of EPC and their functional properties.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have shown that mental challenge under controlled experimental conditions is associated with elevations in inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, relatively little work has been done on the effects of 'naturalistic' stressors on acute changes in inflammatory markers. The present study examined whether perceived arousal, valence and dominance in musicians are associated with pro-inflammatory and oxidative responses to a concert situation. Blood and salivary samples obtained from 48 members of a symphony orchestra on the day of rehearsal (i.e., control situation) and on the following day of premiere concert (i.e., test situation) were used to determine changes in salivary cortisol, pro-inflammatory markers (plasma myeloperoxidase, serum CRP, plasma IL-6), oxidative stress markers (paraoxonase1 activity and malondialdehyde), and homocysteine, a risk factor for vascular disease. Results of regression analyses showed a significant trend to increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) response in individuals with low valence score. Both affective states, valence and arousal, were identified as significant predictors of cortisol response during concert. In addition, control levels of plasma malondialdehyde were positively correlated with differences in IL-6 levels between premiere and rehearsal (r=.38, p=.012), pointing to higher oxidative stress in individuals with pronounced IL-6 response. Our results indicate that stress of public performance leads to increased concentrations of plasma MPO (20%), IL-6 (27%) and salivary cortisol (44%) in musicians. The decreasing effect of pleasantness on the MPO response was highly pronounced in non-smokers (r=-.60, p&lt;.001), suggesting a significant role of emotional valence in stress-induced secretion of MPO. Additional studies are needed to assess the generalizability of these findings to other 'naturalistic' stress situations.",

    "abstract": "2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) has been shown to induce marked atrophic changes of exocrine pancreas of rats when given at 400 ppm in diet. On the other hand, 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) causes pancreatic acinar tumors. Both chemicals also induce intestinal tumors. In the present experiment, the possible promotional effects of PhIP on DMAB-induced carcinogenesis in the rat were investigated with particular attention given to the pancreas and intestine. After initiation with subcutaneous injections of DMAB (150 mg/kg b.w.) once a week for 3 weeks, PhIP was administered in the diet at doses of 200, 100, 25 and 0 ppm from weeks 5 to 40. In a dose-dependent manner, PhIP clearly increased the numbers of basophilic acinar foci and nodules while decreasing development of acidophilic lesions. The incidences of adenocarcinomas of the small intestine but not the colon demonstrated a tendency for an increase with the higher doses of PhIP. The results thus indicated that PhIP administration after DMAB treatment exerts two different effects on pancreatic acinar cell lesions, enhancing the growth of basophilic foci and suppressing that of their acidophilic counterparts. Any influence on alimentary canal tumorigenesis was limited to the small intestine.",

    "abstract": "Sixteen ASA 1 or 2 patients scheduled for abdominal surgery were included in the study after they had given their informed consent. Thirty minutes after starting a low-thoracic epidural anaesthesia (median level of sensitivity loss: T5), the patients were randomly given an intravenous bolus injection of either thiopentone (4 mg.kg-1, n = 8) or etomidate (0.5 mg.-1, n = 8), associated with succinylcholine 1 mg.kg-1. One minute after induction of general anaesthesia, the patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated (V(T) 8 ml.kg-1, rate 12 c.min-1). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (oscillometric method), cardiac output (CO) (transthoracic bioimpedance) and heart rate were recorded semi-continuously. Total peripheral resistances (TPR) were calculated using the formula TPR = (MA/CO)*80. There were no differences between the groups in patient age, height, weight, and cardiovascular consequences of epidural anaesthesia. After anaesthetic induction and before endotracheal intubation, there was a slight decrease in CO in both groups, without any change in MAP. After intubation, MAP increased in both groups through peripheral vasoconstriction, whereas CO did not increase further. A significant tachycardia was occurred only seen in the thiopentone group, before and after tracheal intubation. This study showed that thiopentone and etomidate were suitable drugs for anaesthetic induction in a patient under epidural blockade. However, the absence of tachycardia following etomidate may be beneficial in cardiac patients. The monitoring of cardiac output determinants during thiopentone and etomidate anaesthesia require further invasive investigations.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe an adverse effect with intravenous codeine in a chid diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. CASE SUMMARY: A seven-year-old boy with sickle cell anemia was admitted to the emergency department with severe pain unresponsive to high doses of oral acetaminophen; subsequently, intravenous codeine phosphate was administered. The patient immediately developed a tonic-clonic seizure, which was treated with intravenous diazepam and naloxone. DISCUSSION: Seizures associated with the intravenous administration of codeine phosphate have not been extensively reported in the literature, and special precautions for using the parenteral route for this drug have been vague and limited. Because of the frequent need for acute pain control in children with sicke cell crisis, they may be exposed to this type of reaction when intravenous narcotics are administered. The need for clear guidelines regarding the drug's appropriate parenteral dosing and administration is essential. CONCLUSIONS: Codeine phosphate-induced seizures are not common. The need for special instructions for its intravenous administration may prevent this type of reaction, especially in patients in need of acute pain control requiring intravenous narcotics.",

    "abstract": "Disrupted regulation and accumulation of bile salts (BS) in the liver can contribute towards progressive liver damage and fibrosis. Here, we investigated the role of BS in the progression of cholestatic injury and liver fibrosis using 3D scaffold-free multicellular human liver microtissues (MTs) comprising the cell lines HepaRG, THP-1 and hTERT-HSCs. This in vitro model has been shown to recapitulate cellular events leading to fibrosis including hepatocellular injury, inflammation and activation of HSCs, ultimately leading to increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). In order to better differentiate the contribution of individual cells during cholestasis, the effects of BS were evaluated either on each of the three cell types individually or on the multicellular MTs. Our data corroborate the toxic effects of BS on HepaRG cells and indicate that BS exposure elicited a slight increase in cytokines without causing stellate cell activation. Contrarily, using the MTs, we could demonstrate that low concentrations of BS led to cellular damage and triggered a fibrotic response. This indicates that cellular interplay is required to achieve BS-triggered activation of HSC. Moreover, BS were capable of down-regulating CYP7A1 expression in MTs and elicited abnormal lipid production (accumulation) concordant with clinical cases where chronic cholestasis results in hypercholesterolemia.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy, in a dose-escalation study, of exisulind (an oral sulphone metabolite of sulindac thought to induce apoptosis in malignant cells by inhibiting cGMP-phosphodiesterase) combined with docetaxel in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), as pre-clinical studies suggested activity against prostate cancer and synergy with cytotoxic agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with HRPC were treated with oral exisulind twice daily for 21-day cycles and intravenous docetaxel given for 1 h on the first day of each cycle. Three dose levels were assessed, combining exisulind 150 and 250 mg twice daily with docetaxel at 60 or 75 mg/m2. Toxicity was then evaluated using standard criteria. RESULTS: The recommended phase II dose was determined to be exisulind 250 mg and docetaxel 60 mg/m2, with escalation to 75 mg/m2 after cycle 1, as tolerated. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities among all patients were neutropenia (56%), infection (24%) and hyperglycaemia (18%). Twelve of 32 evaluable patients (38%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 23-55%) had a decline in PSA by at least half. Only four of 17 evaluable patients (95% CI, 1-47%) treated at the phase II dose level had such a decline in PSA. The median (95% CI) overall survival of all patients was 16 (12.9-19.7) months and median progression-free survival 4.7 (2.7-5.2) months. CONCLUSION: The combination of exisulind and docetaxel was tolerable in patients with HRPC. The PSA response rates do not suggest an improvement over historical data with single-agent docetaxel in this population.",

With BM 17.0744-a compound structurally unrelated to thiazolidinediones--antihyperglycemic and antihyperinsulinemic potency has been demonstrated in various animal models of type II diabetes. The antidiabetic effect is independent of the genetic background of the disease, gender, and animal species. The 24-hour blood glucose profile was dose- and time-dependently improved in ob/ob mice after a single and fourth oral administration of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/d. A dose-dependent reduction of hyperglycemia (10%, 15%, 28%, and 66%) was found in db/db mice after the fifth oral administration of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/d. Hyperinsulinemia was reduced dose-dependently in yellow KK mice by 1%, 24%, 34%, and 66% after the fifth oral administration of 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/d. Overall glucose metabolism was predominantly higher in euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies in obese fa/fa rats pretreated for 14 days with 10 mg/kg/d BM 17.0744. The data in diabetic and insulin-resistant animals suggest an improvement of insulin action that is supported by enhancement of insulin effects in vitro. There is no evidence of a risk for hypoglycemia in diabetic and metabolically healthy animals. Triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol were reduced in the serum of metabolically healthy rats, as well as serum lipids in db/db mice, which suggests this effect is independent of amelioration of the diabetic status. Lipid-lowering effects in diabetic and healthy animals show an additional property of BM 17.0744. Because of its antidiabetic and lipid-lowering potency, the substance is of great interest in treating the metabolic syndrome. Lipid decreases in rats are associated with a dose-dependent increase in carnitine acetyltransferase activity in the liver to about 100-fold (12.5 mg/kg/d). This together with hepatomegaly in small rodents may indicate peroxisomal proliferation, a phenomenon considered species-specific. Its relevance for humans is well documented for other classes of compounds including fibrates. Specific side effects of insulin sensitizers of the thiazolidinedione type, such as an increase in body weight and heart weight, could not be observed after 4-week oral application of BM 17.0744 in rats. In general, BM 17.0744 was well tolerated in the pharmacological dose range in all species tested.",

Pretreatment of rats with phenoxybenzamine, an adrenergic receptor antagonist, attenuated the effects of 12.5 mg/kg of p,p'-DDT on the acoustic startle reflex, and decreased the maximum magnitude reduction produced by the prepulse stimulus in DDT-exposed rats.

In addition, we described proteasome-mediated degradation of GR in COL-treated HeLa cells. While these effects were previously attributed to cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, this explanation is not applicable for nonproliferating cells such as human hepatocytes (HH). In the current study, we compared COL-mediated microtubule disruption and cell cycle arrest with selected GR functions in HeLa cells and HH as models of proliferating and quiescent cells, respectively. Microtubule disruption led to irreversible decrease in GR binding capacity and protein level in HeLa cells. None of the parameters was restored 24 hours after COL withdrawal. In contrast, dexamethasone (DEX) binding was increased in HH at the beginning of the treatment, with following transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The findings of these investigations emphasize the GR-signaling differences between primary and transformed cells.",

    "abstract": "Metformin lowers blood pressure in humans and in experimental animal models. To determine the mechanism of acute metformin-induced hypotension, we measured changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during metformin alone (0, 10, 50, 100 mg/kg i.v.; n = 10) and during concomitant alpha adrenergic (phentolamine, 5 mg/kg; n = 5), beta adrenergic (propranolol, 3 mg/kg; n = 6), muscarinic (atropine, 200 micrograms/kg; n = 7), ganglionic (hexamethonium, 30 mg/kg; n = 11), nitric oxide synthase (NG-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt, 15 mg/ kg; n = 9) and combination ganglionic plus alpha adrenergic plus beta adrenergic (n = 6) blockade in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Responses to metformin alone were also assessed in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 6). In SHRs, metformin elicited depressor responses accompanied by tachycardia (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, -26 +/- 3 mm Hg; delta HR, +49 +/- 12 bpm). Depressor responses in Wistar-Kyoto rats were significantly attenuated (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, -9 +/- 4 mm Hg; P &lt; .01). Hypotensive actions of metformin in SHRs were abolished and reversed into pressor responses by hexamethonium (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, +24 +/- 6 mm Hg), phentolamine (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, +62 +/- 10 mm Hg) and by combination ganglionic plus adrenergic (100 mg/kg; delta MAP, +62 +/- 10 mm Hg) blockade. Neither propranolol, atropine nor NG-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt affected hypotensive responses to metformin. We conclude that acute intravenous metformin administration decreases MAP by causing withdrawal of sympathetic activity. The increase in MAP uncovered by hexamethonium and phentolamine suggests that the original depressor response to metformin is buffered by mechanisms unrelated to the autonomic nervous system.",

    "abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ontogeny and subunit expression are altered during developmental lead (Pb2+) exposure. However, it is unknown whether these changes occur at the synaptic or cellular level. Synaptic and extra-synaptic NMDARs have distinct cellular roles, thus, the effects of Pb2+ on NMDAR synaptic targeting may affect neuronal function. In this communication, we show that Pb2+ exposure during synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons altered synaptic NMDAR composition, resulting in a decrease in NR2A-containing NMDARs at established synapses. Conversely, we observed increased targeting of the obligatory NR1 subunit of the NMDAR to the postsynaptic density (PSD) based on the increased colocalization with the postsynaptic protein PSD-95. This finding together with increased binding of the NR2B-subunit specific ligand [3H]-ifenprodil, suggests increased targeting of NR2B-NMDARs to dendritic spines as a result of Pb2+ exposure. During brain development, there is a shift of NR2B- to NR2A-containing NMDARs. Our findings suggest that Pb2+ exposure impairs or delays this developmental switch at the level of the synapse. Finally, we show that alter expression of NMDAR complexes in the dendritic spine is most likely due to NMDAR inhibition, as exposure to the NMDAR antagonist aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV) had similar effects as Pb2+ exposure. These data suggest that NMDAR inhibition by Pb2+ during synaptogensis alters NMDAR synapse development, which may have lasting consequences on downstream signaling.",

    "title": "Polymorphism in the ERCC2 codon 751 is associated with arsenic-induced premalignant hyperkeratosis and significant chromosome aberrations. ",
    "abstract": "In West Bengal, India more than 6 million people are exposed to high levels of arsenic through drinking water. Since, only 15-20% of the exposed individuals show arsenic-induced skin lesions, it is assumed that genetic variation might play an important role in arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity. Arsenic exposure often leads to the development of hyperkeratosis, the precursor of arsenic-induced skin cancer. ERCC2 (excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 2) is a nucleotide excision repair pathway gene, and its SNPs have been implicated in several types of epithelial cancers. We investigated the possible association of ERCC2 codon 751 A--&gt;C polymorphism (lysine to glutamine) with arsenic-induced hyperkeratosis and correlated ERCC2 genotypes with increased frequencies of chromosomal aberration to ascertain whether any genotype leads to sub-optimal DNA repair. For this association study, 318 unrelated arsenic exposed subjects (165 with hyperkeratosis and 153 without any arsenic-induced skin lesions), drinking water contaminated with arsenic to a similar extent, were recruited. Genotyping was done through PCR-RFLP procedure. Lys/Lys genotype was significantly over-represented in the arsenic-induced hyperkeratosis-exhibiting group [odds ratio (OR) = 4.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.75-8.23]. A statistically significant increase in both CA/cell and percentage of aberrant cells was observed in the individuals with AA genotype compared to those with AC or CC genotype combined (P &lt; 0.01) in each of the two study groups, as also, in the total study population. This study indicates that ERCC2 codon 751 Lys/Lys genotype is significantly associated with arsenic-induced premalignant hyperkeratosis and is possibly due to sub-optimal DNA repair capacity of the ERCC2 codon 751 Lys/Lys genotype.",

    "abstract": "Phenytoin (PHT) is a commonly used anticonvulsant drug. It has been reported that children exposed prenatally to PHT have brain malformations and psychomotor dysfunction. The neonatal development of the central nervous system (CNS) in mice corresponds to the last trimester in humans. To examine the neurotoxic effects of PHT on postnatal brain development, we administered PHT at doses of 10, 17.5, 25, or 35 mg/kg to newborn mice once a day during postnatal days (PD) 2-4. These dose levels result in plasma levels corresponding to the therapeutic ranges in humans. We measured the weight of total brain, cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem on PD 5 through 21, and examined early motor functions including head elevation, elevation of pelvis, pivoting, crawling, and righting reflex . Total brain weight, cerebral weight, and cerebellar weight in the group treated with 25 or 35 mg/kg were significantly reduced compared to controls from PD 5 to 21. Mice treated with PHT at 25 or 35 mg/kg showed decreased locomotor abilities and righting reflex on PD 5. In all phenytoin treatment groups, phenytoin levels in the brain were higher than those in the plasma on the third day of PHT treatment. We thus observed neurotoxic effects of PHT on postnatal brain development in mice. Our present data may provide useful implications for the management of PHT-induced developmental neurotoxicity and evaluation of psychomotor development in children exposed to PHT during the late fetal period.",

METHODS: Twenty seven patients with gout were included in a fenofibrate plus anti-hyperuricaemic agents combination study, and 25 in a losartan plus anti-hyperuricaemic agents combination study. Serum uric acid concentration, uric acid clearance, and 24 hour urinary uric acid excretion were measured before and two months after the addition of fenofibrate (300 mg once daily) or losartan (50 mg once daily) to anti-hyperuricaemic agents. RESULTS: Combination therapy of fenofibrate or losartan with anti-hyperuricaemic agents, which included benzbromarone (50 mg once daily) or allopurinol (200 mg twice a day), significantly reduced serum uric acid concentrations in accordance with increased uric acid excretion. CONCLUSION: A combination of fenofibrate or losartan with anti-hyperuricaemic agents is a good option for the treatment of gout patients with hypertriglyceridaemia and/or hypertension, though the additional hypouricaemic effect may be modest.",
